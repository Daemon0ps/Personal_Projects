Sprig: Ah, the annual Plantar fishing trip. I can't wait to cast off.
Anne: Me either, my froggy friend. But I'm not fishing. I'm parasailing, baby!
Polly: Wow! Flying? What a great way to spy on my enemies. (evil laugh)
Anne: What do you say, Sprig? Why fish when you can fly?
Sprig: Ooh, tempting. But, nope. I'd rather fish. It's what Hop Pop and I have done on this trip ever since I was a pollywog. (gasps) First we'd get the bait ready.
(grunting)
(screams)
Sprig: Then he'd let me steer the boat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sprig: Then we'd spend the rest of the day fishing together. We look forward to this all year. It's our special time, and that's never gonna change.
Sylvia: Hello, children. I'm so glad I get to join you all on this boat trip.
Oh, hey, Sylvia.
You're coming, too? Cool!
Oh. Hey, Sylvia.
Has anyone seen Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Morning, kids. Ready for the brisk open waters? Ahoy, there.
Anne: Dang, HP. Looking good.
Sylvia: Isn't he dreamy?
Oh, hey. Well-- (giggling)
Now come on, my dear. I'll show you around the boat.
Oh, how lovely!
Sprig: What the heck? He can't fish in that ridiculous outfit.
Anne: Looks like Hop Pop's fishing for something else.
Polly: Ew. Gross, Anne.
Sprig: (blows raspberry) This doesn't change a thing. He and I are still gonna spend the day together and have our special time.
-Anchors away, and here we go! -(Sylvia) Whoo!
(Anne) Boat trip! Yeah!
(Sprig) Let's do it!
Eh, we'll fix it when we get back.
To the sea!
(clatters)
You let go.
No, you let go.
No, you.
No, you.
(giggling)
Parasailing is easy. The wind does all the work.
Where did you learn all this again?
Hours and hours of extensive research.
Sweet. Mom! Can I try parasailing?
(mom speaking Thai) Mi tae khun samarth phabpha di hak txngkar. (No, but you can fold your laundry if you want.)
Ugh. Never mind! I'm sure he's fine.
Whoo! Time to prove my mom wrong-- Ah!
(Anne screaming)
Looking good, Anne. (laughs)
(groaning)
Um, don't you and Hop Pop usually do that together?
He said to start without him. Ouch.
Hey. This doesn't mean anything. Hop Pop and I are still gonna--
Wait, they're fishing together?
Now, follow through on your-- Oh! You're a natural.
Well, I have a great teacher.
Oh! (both giggle)
Whoa! (crash)
(groans)
I can't believe this. He's ditching me?
(Anne screaming, grunts)
I really think I'm getting the hang of this.
Anne, you're not going to believe this. Hop Pop is--
I know, dude. I saw the whole thing from up top.
Bummer. But what can you do, right?
It's not like you can make Sylvia go awa-- (screams)
Over here, Sylvia!
I wanna show you this thing Sprig and I used to do that's super fun.
(grunts)
Hey! I know that look.
You're going to sabotage this fishing trip so that Sylvia leaves, aren't you?
What? No! What do I look like, some petty child to you?
Yes. (yells)
Chum bomb! (groans)
(evil laugh)
(giggling)
(evil laugh)
Oh!
Ah!
Whoa!
Ooh!
(gasps)
Oh!
(groans)
(sighs)
 A little baby frog like me 
 Thought of only possibility 
 Of hanging with my Hop 
 Of hanging with my Pop 
 But now what once was two Is three 
 And it's looking pretty dark To me 
 This baby baby frog is sad 
(sighs)
(Anne screaming)
(grunts)
Hey, Anne.
You almost had that one!
Really? No.
Whoo! Gonna get back out there.
Dude, you have to shake off this whole Hop Pop thing
and just have fun.
We're on a boat-- (screams)
Sprig, Anne is right.
Maybe it's time to let this one go.
You know, be the-- (inhales) bigger frog (exhales) and all that.
Excuse me? You mean just-- Whoa.
Give up my special time with Hop Pop?
Why not? Crazier things have happened.
Like that.
No! Stinkbugs!
Bleh! (screams) Uh-oh!
(groans)
Whoa!
Sprig? Can we talk? Uh!
Sylvia, great to see you. Why, of course we can talk. I love to talk. Let's talk.
You're a tense little boy.
Come on.
And now, back to our show. (giggles)
(thumping) (Anne) Ah! No! Not in the mouth!
Sprig, is there something bothering you?
(laughs) What? Me? No. Never. Who? How?
Mmm-hmm. Well, I just want you to know
I'm having an amazing time with you and your family today.
I mean, just feel that breeze! See the sights!
Just look at that island over there.
Ain't those just the prettiest blossoms you've ever seen?
(muffled evil laughter)
Funny thing, Sylvia.
Those are Hop Pop's favorite flowers.
No kidding?
Oh, he loves them.
In fact, he'd really appreciate it
if you swam over there and picked him a couple as a surprise.
Why, Sprig, that is a fine idea.
Not to brag, but I'm quite the swimmer.
I'll be back in about 15 minutes. Tops.
(muttering) Yeah, we'll see about that.
Thanks again, Sprig.
(evil laughter) Wait.
This is going too far.
 This baby baby frog is sad 
(singsong) Oh, Hop Pop!
We don't have much time.
-Let's-- -(Hop Pop) Oh, there you are, boy.
Sylvia thought you might want fishing time with me.
She... She did?
Yep. She said she could tell something was bugging you
and suggested I spend some quality time with you.
So, here I am.
Sylvia's... a pretty cool lady.
You're lucky to have her.
Oh, I thank Frog for her every day.
Hop Pop, not related to anything, but, uh,
can we turn this boat around, please?
(Sylvia screams)
That's Sylvia! She's in trouble!
What's she doing off the boat? I'll explain later.
We heard Sylvia scream. Is everything okay?
She's back there.
(Anne) Where? I can't see her.
If only we had a bird's-eye view.
Step aside.
Sprig, it's not as easy as it looks.
How is he doing that?
I see her. Over there.
(screams)
Whoa!
(whimpers)
I'm coming, Syl.
(groaning, screaming)
This crab is making me very scared!
But also very hungry.
(gasps)
Hang on, Sylvia.
(grunts)
Put the boat in reverse. Put the boat in reverse.
Aye-aye, Sprig.
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Get back to the briny depths of filth where you belong, you son of a sea slug!
Wow, HP. That's a lot of woman.
(chuckles) Don't I know it.
Oh, Sylvia! You're safe.
Sure am, and that's not all.
Got your favorite flowers.
Um, my favorite flowers are daffodils.
Everybody knows that.
(chuckles) They funny.
(sighs)
Sylvia, I have a confession to make.
The reason you were on that island and almost became a crab snack
is because I'm a selfish, petty child
who wanted his Hop Pop all to himself.
Oh, now he admits it.
You're a cool lady. And Hop Pop's lucky to have you.
We all are.
Well, thank you, Sprig.
I know sharing a man like Hoppy is difficult.
After all, he's such a catch.
(babbles)
Now what do you say we cut the chatter and get fishing?
Together. Yeah!
Whoo! Yes!
 And this baby baby frog 
 Is glad  (shouts)
Chum bomb, you little weenie!
Polly out!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
So, does anyone else wanna go back for that crab, though?
I mean, yowza. That thing probably had a ton of meat, right?
Anyone?
Don't leave me hanging here, people.
