(all groaning)
We need to find Bessie.
(chirping)
(grumbling)
Hang on, girl!
-(Apothecary Gary) Not so fast. -(all gasp)
(screaming)
You have yo admit this is all pretty cool.
See how versatile plants can be?
(all) Not the time, Hop Pop!
Well, Plantars, are you ready...
-(beeping) -...to be fertilizer?
Hold on, can anyone hear that?
Kind of an obnoxious beeping sound?
Resistance base located. Extermination team deployed.
Oh, hey. When did that get there?
Extermination team? What the heck is that?
(rumbling)
(both scream) It burns us!
(all screaming)
Our precious plants! No!
I know a golden opportunity when I see one.
Come on, guys!
(villagers screaming)
Well, that worked out.
Yeah, sure did.
(sighs)
You wanna go back and help them, don't you? Yes, please.
(groans)
Don't hurt me. I'm just a cute little beetle!
(grunts)
Hyah!
Plantars? You're back?
Yes. Burn!
(screeching)
We'll help too!
Charge!
(groaning)
(groaning)
(all panting)
Dang, Gary. That was some incredible coordination.
Thanks. It comes with the whole hive mind situation.
You and your kids fight well too.
What can I say? We've had a lot of practice.
Okay, well, I think, um...
We're still going to try and kill you guys.
Yeah, let's just go with that. Attack!
Gary, wait! I know we've had some bad history.
You tried to enslave my hometown,
and I violently murdered you that one time.
-Yes. Yes, you did. -But your skills
as a botanist and farmer are undeniable!
(chuckles) Oh, stop. You're making me blush!
My whole life, I've been lookin' for folks
who care about farming as much as I do.
And, well, here you are!
Won't you join our Resistance
and help us take down King Andrias?
Well, I don't know...
Gary, if we don't do something,
the village will always be under threat.
That's right! They know the location of your willage now.
That's a good point.
And Gardenton is so isolated,
I had no idea how bad it was out there.
Well, Hopediah, you can count on us!
Let us know when and where to be, and we will be there.
I cannot believe this is happening. Ditto.
Hey, Gary, one more thing.
Andrias has been using these mind-control collars,
and we think they're utilizing spores similar to yours.
Huh? Then that means there must be at least one more of me out there.
Oh, that's amazing!
And who knows? Maybe it's a lady mushroom.
That's not a thing.
Yes. (chuckles) Well, everyone knows that.
Okay, see ya around!
(wind whistling)
(clears throat) So, anyone else lovin' the feel of these dresses?
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Heck yeah!
Mm-hmm. A guy can really breathe in these.
