(A bug with a rooster's face crows early in the morning. The camera cuts to Ivy's room and her alarm bug buzzes. Ivy jumps down from the ceiling.)
Ivy: Hi-yah! (She turns off her alarm bug.) Think you can sneak up on me, alarm bug? I've been awake for hours! (She goes to her hanger and jumps up to put on her hat. She then grabs a net and kicks her bedroom door open.) Boom! (Just as she is about to leave the house, Felicia grabs her net, stopping her.)
Felicia: Excuse me, young lady. Where do you think you're going?
Ivy: I'm meetin' Sprig for some Glitter Bug huntin'. I told you last night, remember?
Felicia: I remember saying you had to finish your chores first.
Ivy: Aww.
Felicia: Now let's see how good a job you did. (She picks up a plate.) Aha! What's this?
Ivy: A plate?
Felicia: (Showing a spot of dirt on the plate with a magnifying glass) A filthy plate! (She picks up a napkin swan.) And just look at these napkin swans. Their necks are looking pretty sad. (The napkin swan's neck droops.)
Ivy: Aw, come on, Mom. They're good enough.
Felicia: They most certainly are not! Now fix your shoddy work or you aren't goin' anywhere, young lady.
Ivy: But, Mom, I'm gonna be late!
Felicia: Up, bup, bup. Should have thought of that before you rushed your chores. (She hears knocking on the door.) Heavens! That'll be the morning rush! (She opens the door and some elderly frogs come in.) Come on in, everyone! My favorite time of day. Oh, Mr. Patterson, is that a new scarf? (Ivy groans with annoyance.)
(Meanwhile, Sprig is on a tree stump.)
Sprig: (clears throat) Hello, Ivy. Uh, how's it hanging, Ivy? Hmm. Oh, Ivy. Sorry, didn't see you there. (Suddenly, Ivy pops up from the tree stump, sending him flying.)
Ivy: Ambush!
Sprig: Hey, Ivy. I wasn't here talking to myself. That's for sure. (chuckles)
Ivy: Uh-huh. Well, sorry I'm late. My mom was on my case again. It's so annoying!
Sprig: I'm sure she's got her reasons.
Ivy: I guess.
(Anne and Polly pass by, doing fight moves.)
Anne and Polly: Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai!
Polly: We're Muay Thai-ing!
Sprig and Ivy: You're what?
Anne: It's a form of traditional Thai martial arts. My mom enrolled me in a class when she realized how high-spirited I was.
(We go to the past where Anne is banging on a pot with spoons as a toddler.)
Toddler Anne:  I'll tell you what I need
What I really, really need 
Mrs. Boonchuy: You know what Mommy really needs? You. Out of her kitchen. (speaks Thai) Txn ni! (Now!) (The flashback ends.)
Polly: Anne's gonna teach me some sweet moves. You guys wanna join?
Ivy: Aw, man, that sounds awesome. But Sprig and I can't. We're about to go Glitter Bug hunting.
Anne and Polly: Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai!
Ivy: Now, let's catch some bugs. (She takes Sprig's hand.)
Sprig: Okay!
(Ivy catches a Glitter Bug as it climbs a tree.)
Ivy: Gotcha.
Sprig: Nice one.
Ivy: So tell me more about your adventures on the road. I wanna hear all the details.
Sprig: (clears throat) Well, they really looked up to me in Bittyburg. And Ribbitvale was crazy ritzy, but I fit right in. (chuckles) I pretty much have friends in every town from here to Newtopia.
Ivy: Ah, your trip sounds amazing. Man, I've never even been out of Wartwood. (She puts the Glitter Bug she caught into Sprig's jar.)
Sprig: Well, next time I head out of the valley, maybe you can come with me. I mean if you want, no big deal.
Ivy: Heck, yeah, I do! (gasps) Check it out. (She points to a white Glitter Bug with colorful patterns. She and Sprig jump to the top of a tree.) All right, Sprig. Time for the super net. (She and Sprig combine their nets together, making a big net.)
Both: Aha! Ready? One, two, three...
(Suddenly, a bee-like phone creature appears and Felicia's voice is heard from it.)
Felicia: Ivy Sundew! (Ivy screams as she falls off the tree and lands with a faceplant. The Glitter Bug then flies away.)
Ivy: No! Come back!
Felicia: Ivy, you're late for your tea ceremony lessons.
Ivy: But, Mom, me and Sprig just got started!
Felicia: Don't "but, Mom" me. Come home this instant! (Ivy grunts angrily and punches the tree, knocking Sprig off it.)
Sprig: (dreamy) She's so cool.
(Meanwhile, Anne and Polly are about to do Muay Thai.)
Anne: Okay, listen well, my young pollywog. Muay Thai is all about...
Polly: (About to attack) Enough talk! (Just as she is about to hit Anne, she hits her.)
Polly: Ow. Wha... How did you...
Anne: You're too eager. My instructor always used to tell me: "Jai yen yen." It means to have patience and a cool heart.
Polly: Hi-yah! (Anne dodges her and she goes through the bushes and hits Wally.)
Wally: Ouch! (He appears from the grass carrying Polly.) Uh... totally wasn't watching. Nothing creepy going on here. Say, that looks like fun. Mind if I give it a try?
Polly: Ha. You? Good luck, Wallers. (Wally starts doing Muay Thai with Anne.) Huh?
Anne: Holy cow, Wally. You're pretty good at this. You see this right here, Polly? This is what you should be doing.
Polly: Hmm.
(At Ivy's house, Felicia is about to give her daughter her tea lessons.)
Felicia: First things first. We need to evaluate your attention to detail. Now, this was my table setting from this morning. And this was yours. (Ivy's table setting has a tea pot uncovered.)
Ivy: What's wrong with it? There's no difference!
Felicia: You're just missing that extra something-something. (She puts the cover over the tea pot.) It's the details that count, Ivy. Now, I'll demonstrate. Then you follow. We'll start with folding the swan napkins. (She folds a napkin into a swan and it sparkles. Ivy does the same thing, but it is different than hers.) We all have our off days, I suppose. (Ivy growls.) Next, let's steep the tea. (She spins some tea bags above tea cups. Ivy does the same thing, but one of her tea bags lands in one of the tea cups. Felicia clears her throat.) Careful. Don't break my frog china. (Ivy growls and steam comes out of her ears.) Oh, shoot, did I leave a kettle on? Oh, we'll deal with that in a bit. Now for my favorite part. Changin' the tablecloth! (She spins and places a tablecloth on a table. Ivy only puts hers halfway onto her table.) Ivy, if you're going to do things halfway, we'll just have to start over.
Ivy: That does it! I don't want to do any of this boring, frilly garbage. I wanna travel the world and have my own adventures.
Felicia: The only thing that's garbage is your attitude, young lady. A nice cup of oolong will cure that right up. (She pours some tea.)
Ivy: (shouts) Do you care about anything other than tea?! (She goes upstairs.) You just don't get me, Mom! (She slams her bedroom door, causing some tea china to fall off a shelf. Luckily, Felicia catches them with her arm, leg, and head and she growls. In Ivy's room,)
Ivy: (sighs) I've got to get out of here. (She looks at a poster that says "Adventure waits for no one.") Posters on my wall, are you trying to tell me something? (scoffs) Well, I can't just leave! There has to be another way! Well, it's hard to argue with that logic. (At the Plantar Farm, Sprig is shooting rocks with his slingshot in his room. Just as he shoots another rock, another one hits him in the head from behind.)
Sprig: Whoa. How'd I do that? Huh? Ivy?
Ivy: Come on, Sprig. You and I are leaving the valley. Tonight.
Sprig: Wha...
Ivy: You said you had friends in every town from here to Newtopia, right?
Sprig: Uh, yeah. But...
Ivy: Great. You can be my guide. Let's go!
Sprig: Aha! (grunting)
Ivy: Woo-hoo! Freedom. No more tea, no more swan napkins... just me, you, and the open road.
Sprig: (grunting) Ivy, hypothetically, what if I was exaggerating about how much of an out-of-valley expert I was?
Felicia: Ivy Hibiscus Matcha Sundew! (Ivy looks up and sees three bee-like phone creatures above.) You come home this instant! You're in big trouble, young lady. (One of the bee-like phone creatures lowers next to Ivy and she grabs it by the nose.)
Ivy: Oh, yeah, Mom?! Well, me and Sprig are runnin' away and leaving Wartwood for good! So there!
Felicia: You kids are in big trouble!
Ivy: (screams) Run! (She grabs Sprig by the arm and takes off.)
(shouts)
Anne: Not bad, Polly. But you still lack...
- (screams) - ...patience.
Polly: This is impossible! I'll learn how to fly before I learn...
- (grunts) - (screams)
Oh, hey, thanks.
Felicia: Ivy Sundew, I've had it with your disobedience!
Ivy: Well, I've had it with your nitpicking, your rules, and your tea lessons!
Felicia: (sighs) I can't believe I have raised such an ungrateful and disrespectful daughter!
Ivy: Oh, yeah? Well, then... maybe I don't even wanna be your daughter!
(all gasp)
Ivy: Sorry, it's just... I wanna see the world, you know? Get my hands dirty, learn martial arts, things like that.
Felicia: Martial arts, eh? Fine. You don't have to take tea lessons anymore, if you can beat me in a martial arts fight. Three rounds. And you only need to win one.
Ivy: Wha... Seriously? Me against you? (laughs) This is gonna be easy.
- (bell rings) - (Anne) Begin.
(shouts) Huh?
(all) Whoa.
Huh, must've been a lucky dodge. Here I come! (screams)
(shouts)
(growls)
Huh?
And Felicia gets the boop! Round one to Felicia!
Whoa. Where'd you learn those moves?
Oh, picked them up on my travels.
Travels? What travels?
Two for Felicia!
It's the third and final round. Whoever wins this, wins it all.
(shouts)
(shouts)
(grunting)
Tsk, tsk. Shouldn't have rushed in.
Now you're gettin' it.
(growls, sighs) Finish it.
- Fold the swan napkin. - Huh?
I said fold the swan napkin.
(chuckle) I got free, but-but...
- Now sift the tea. - What?
Sift... the... tea!
Now, Ivy, change the tablecloth.
(all gasp)
(gasps)
It's all right. Do it.
Round three to Ivy! Ivy wins! Whoo!
Mom, where did you learn those moves?
I was a little bit of an adventurer myself back in the day.
Where do you think my exotic selection of teas comes from?
Or my frog china?
I-I had no idea.
Ivy, you think I don't see you, but I do.
You want to travel the world, and I get it.
But you have to be patient, because it's dangerous out there,
and I just want you to be ready before we go.
(gasp) You don't mean...
Mm-hmm. All of these tea exercises were to prepare you
for when I take you on my next tea-gathering adventure.
(gasp) You're the best mom ever!
Mmm. I still can't believe you used to be some kind of world traveler.
(chuckles) Oh, honey. Where do you think I met your father?
Mom, please!
Well, I guess our work here is done.
To be honest, I have no idea what's going on.
Hey, have you guys seen Polly?
Gotcha!
You what? (groans)
That was technically your fault.
Eh, there's a good chance he won't remember this.
