It's so fortunate that the music box
fell into such average hands.
How exactly did it come into you possession?
Uh... Uh-uh.
You know? I don't remember how we got it.
(rumbling)
Huh... What was that?
Nothing much. Just an avalanche.
(all) What? Everybody run!
Shush, you loud little frog baby!
(rumbling)
Whew. Looks like it's heading away from us.
(Anne) Wait a second. Look!
What about that little hut? It looks like someone inside.
We have to save them!
How? By running towards an avalanche?
They are lost, child. I say we press on.
(groans)
Nuts to that!
(all) Anne!
(grunts) Hey! You guys gotta get outta-- Huh?
How is eveyone out to lunch right now?
-(rumbling) -(grunting)
Anne! We gotcha!
(grunting)
You okay? (pants) I'm fine. I'm fine.
Let's just hurry and get to the temple.
(Valeriana) Oh, that won't be happening.
I've learned all I need to know about you lot.
Disobedient, foolish, impulsive.
None of these qualities are worthy of the sacred stones.
You don't deserve my help.
Good luck finding that temple on your own.
You are full of such frog split!
(all gasp)
Oh, come on. You barely even gave us a chance!
Not only that, now you're gonna strand us out gere?
Well, we may be unworthy, but you and your order are even worse!
You're nothing but a cruel, judgmental, snob!
(echoes)
Brat!
You dare insult the order I have dedicated my entire life to?
Yeah? What're you gonna do about it?
Huh?
Did you guys see that?
Huh? Whoa!
Where are we?
What did you do?
Just show me and my friends where the temple is already.
Never. You are not worthy.
In fact, none are worthy!
And now that I finally have you alone,
I can return the box to its rightful guardian...
me!
Huh? (squawks)
Hey, wait! No!
No! I need that to get home!
(Valeriana) Aha! See?
Still only thinking of yourself!}} !Anne |You're wrong! I'm not... that selfish! |-
!Valeriana |Oh no? Didn't you lie to the Plantars to get out of a day of work? |-
!Anne |(panting) How-- How do you know that? Whoa! |-
!Valeriana |Didn't you drive the family snail even though you were told not to? |-
!Anne |(grunts) Okay. This is getting weird. What else do you know? |-
!Valeriana |I know that you snore. |-
!Anne |Could've kept that one to yourself. Whoa! |-
!Valeriana |Didn't you still Hopediah's wallet for a girls' day on the town? |-
|colspan=2 align=center|Okay. That is definitely not how that happened.
But you did steal the music box. Did you not?
I... I... I did steal it.
So it is. You are a liar and a thief!
And now, the box will be mine!
(laughs)
(screams, grunts)
(laughing)
Why are you laughing?
You can't get back down the mountain without me.
Ha! You have to save me.
Don't I just wave the stick up and down to get back?
You weren't supposed to figure that out! (screams)
(grunts)
(grunts, sighs)
(sighs) You risked your life to save me?
But why?
You were right. I did lie and steal.
If that makes me unworthy, fine.
Those bad choices were mine and I'll own them.
But making them taught me that it's always better to do the right thing.
So that's what I did, regardless of how much I didn't want to.
We have been waiting for someone like you for such a long time.
Um... excuse me?
Whoa, mama. You clean up nice.
You have sacrificed your warmth for your friends,
your safety for a stranger in need.
You even risked your life for an enemy.
But empathy alone isn't enough, for what is heart without responsibility?
In the name of the temple,
I declare you worthy.
Wait! No way! So the cardinal, the avalanche--
-All this was-- -A trial.
You see, we've been making our way through the "temple" this whole time.
And I have been testing you.
(squawks) Testing you!
(clears throat) So, what is it you want?
Oh, right. To charge the stone and return home!
So be it!
(grunts)
(beeping)
It's a lot slower than last time.
Sorry. This thing's pretty old.
Ah! No, no, no. I get it. No problem.
Do you want, uh, something to read or...
Seriously, it's fine. (Plantars screaming)
Oh, no! They're in trouble. What if it's another avalanche?
Uh, that looks charged enough. Let's go!
Send me back! Send me back! Send me back! Send me back!
(wind howling)
Send me back! Oh!
(screaming) Hang on, guys!
I got you! Huh?
Anne!
Marcy is showing us ridiculously cute animal videos on her phone.
We looked for you, but now we're taking a break.
Anne, you're all right.
And that's not all, fam.
Wha-pow!
(all) Ooh! Whoo!
But how? I'll explain later.
But for now, can we please get out of this cold?
(laughs) Yeah!
Way to go, Anne! Way to go!
(Polly) Anne!
Maybe Frobo can make us hot chocolate when we get back.
-Oooh! -(Polly) Yay!
-(Sprig) Yes! -(Anne) That sounds great. |-
