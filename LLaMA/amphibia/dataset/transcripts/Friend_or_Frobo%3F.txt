Polly: This is so great! Our first day in forever with no responsibilities! So, what are we gonna do?
Hop Pop: Ha! You'll see.
(Hop Pop soon stops in front of the seed store.)
Polly: Oh, no!
Hop Pop: Yep!
Polly: Oh, come on! Don't worry, Marcy. We don't have to go into the boring old-
Marcy: This is so cool. A store just for seeds? Boy, we could be there for hours!
Hop Pop: Don't tempt me!
Marcy and Hop Pop: (laughs)
Marcy: The humble seed. So much potential for growth!
Hop Pop: One of the rare things life where you actually get out what you put in! It's beautiful! (laughs as he and Marcy head to the store)
Anne: Have fun in there!
Sprig: Yeah, we're good here in the wagon.
Hop Pop: Oh, and look after Polly you two.
(door shuts)
Polly: Perfect. Now that the nerds are gone, you guys want to go make mischief? Guys?
(game plays)
Polly: Hey! Did you hear me?
Anne: You know, in the past, I would have said yes, but I think I'm getting a little too old for that nonsense.
Sprig: Sorry, Polly. But me and Anne have changed. We're different now.
Anne: Some of us even sound different.
Sprig: What?
Anne: Nothing. Anyway, I think we should focus our energy on more mature activities. Sprig! Use your kitty cat blasters!
Sprig: On it!
(zaps)
Polly: So no one wants to cause trouble with me?
Anne: Sorry, dude. And if case you didn't hear, we're responsible for you.
Polly: Boo!
Anne: You'll get it one day, when you have someone to look after.
Polly: Death first!
Game: You're dead!
Sprig: Dang it!
Polly: You two are responsible for me, huh? So I guess that means that you're responsible for this!
(seeds clattering)
Employee: What the-
(door opens)
Employee: Who's responsible for this?
Polly: They are!
Employee: Yous two! Get over here and clean this up!
Sprig: We're sorry!
Anne and Sprig: Sorry, sorry, sorry!
(birds peck at seeds, Anne and Sprig)
Anne: Not the eyes, not the eyes!
(laughs) Later, losers.
(clucking) (screams)
No, no, no, no!
(giggling)
Pssh! Who needs those two?
Hmm, now, how can I be rambunctious to the max?
(giggles)
People of Wartwood,
welcome to the splash zone.
(screams)
- Hmm?
Polly: Aw. Really thought that splash would be bigger. Hmm. (gasps)
Mmm. Beetle pie.
(straining)
Argh! Curse these puny arms.
(screams, grunts)
(sighs) Mischief's no dang fun alone. Stupid Anne. Stupid Sprig. (grunts)
Hmm.
(gasps)
What the heck? Is somebody in there?
(screams, grunts)
(gasps)
Oh, my frog! A monster! Stay back!
Huh? Ha! You clown. You're copying me.
(laughs)
(distorted laugh)
Whoa, your laugh is horrifying. I love it! You're no monster. You're just a big tadpole. I'm Polly, by the way. What's your name?
Can't talk, huh? You really are a baby.
(grunting)
You look like one of those things from the fighting game on Anne's phone. What was it called? A Robo. Except you're more like a frog. (gasps) I will call you Frobo.
(laughs) I know, I know. I'm a genius. So what else can you do?
(slurps) (squawks)
(gargles, spits) No more for me, thanks.
Whoa! (chuckles)
I don't believe this. I have my own frog dang sidekick. Frobo, how'd you like to have some fun?
Ooh, pie.
Hey, Frobo, grab that beetle pie for me.
(screams) Oh, hey, it's cherry.
Run, Frobo!
Hey, check this out.
(grunts) Whoo-hoo! Ha!
Whoo! Your turn.
Oh, a bit of, uh, property damage there. (giggles)
(sirens wailing) Oh, shoot!
Frobo, it's time to fro-go!
(groans)
(laughs)
(laughs)
(laughing) Whoo!
(laughs)
- Hello? - (blares)
You thinking what I'm thinking, Larry?
On three. One, two, three.
(both) Giant octopus! Case closed.
That's why you and I are partners, Larry.
The best ever.
Whoo!
I don't know what Anne was so worried about.
Taking care of someone is easy.
All right, Frobo. Time to enter the splash zone.
(laughs)
Come on, buddy. Your turn.
This might've been a mistake.
(screams)
(screams)
(groans)
Oh, no!
- (glass shatters) - (sobs) No!
Hey! Can't a guy try a new hairstyle in peace?
(gasps) Sweet sassy molassy.
What is that?
It's some kind of hulking monster.
Good gravy. Look at that.
Well, whatever it is, it destroyed the fountain.
Second time this week too.
It's some kind of metal abomination.
No, no! He's not dangerous.
He's just a big, sweet dum-dum.
Frobo, show them. Do a trick.
- (all screaming) - Gadzooks.
Quick! We gotta destroy it.
(townspeople clamoring)
No, wait! Stop!
I told you he was harmless. Now, back off.
Oof!
Wow, you really kicked me there.
Oh, whoops. Sorry, Polly.
Welp, that don't look good.
(roars)
No!
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(all screaming)
Finally, done cleaning up. Now let's find Polly.
(all screaming)
Wha... What is that thing?
Is that some kind of crazy frog robot?
Uh, maybe. (all scream)
Well, whatever it is, we've got to stop it before it hurts anyone.
(screams) No, wait! Guys!
(trembling)
(Anne) Hey, you!
(screams)
(grunts)
(grunting)
Hey, put her down, you big... (grunts)
Tha... That all you got?
(both gasp)
Hang in there, kids.
Frobo, no!
(all exclaiming)
(both gasp)
No! Everybody stop!
Frobo, I know you're just trying to protect me.
Everything you did today
was because I asked you to.
And now I'm asking you to stop.
Po... Po... Polly.
(gasps) Frobo, your first words.
Well, now that it's calmed down, let's tear this thing apart!
Never!
Come on, Toadstool,
isn't there another way?
It seems like Polly really likes him.
Anne, I know this town
is no stranger to crazy at this point...
- But come on. - This Frobo thing is a menace.
It destroyed my shack. I mean, someone's gotta answer for this mess.
(sighs) You're right. I will.
This wasn't Frobo's fault. It was mine.
I taught him how to do all of this.
I'm sorry about the damage.
I'll do whatever it takes to fix it all up.
But leave Frobo alone. He's innocent.
Frobo, say you're sorry.
So... Sorry.
It said sorry and I suppose that's good enough for me, eh.
We don't even have handcuffs that big anyway.
(groans) I guess we already accepted two monsters.
Yep. I mean, what's one more at this point?
(chuckles) I can't believe they had tomato plant seeds.
I still think you shouldn't have bought those.
- Wha... What in tarnation? - (gasps)
Hey, Hop Pop.
Oh, my gosh! Is that a robot?
Where did it come from? What is it made of? Can I have one?
What's a robot? Too hard to explain.
So, I know this is a lot to take in,
but can we please keep him?
I'll be his big sister.
I'm ready to take care of someone.
Whoa! Wow, what a turn around.
Uh, I'm not sure, Polly.
It sure seems dangerous.
I mean, can it do anything useful?
Show 'em, Frobo.
(beeping)
Ooh! Welcome to the family, Mr. Frobo.
So, do anything else?
(chuckles) (cheers)
Don't mind if I do. Hey!
It's multigrain.
Wow! First underground computers and now a robot? Wait a second.
Sprig, you don't think that thing was what got built in the ruins of disaster, do you?
No way! And followed us all the way home?
That would have been hundreds of miles.
Could be. (both) Hmm.
