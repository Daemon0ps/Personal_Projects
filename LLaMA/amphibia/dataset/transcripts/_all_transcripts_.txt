(Open on a thrift store on Earth as a car passes by. Cut to inside.)
Old Man: (picks up shirt) Ah, this is a good shirt.
Anne: All right, Anne. You can do this.
Saleswoman: (snoring)
(She takes a music box with three colored gems, puts it in her bag, and one of her friends gives a thumbs up from outside as she leaves.)
(Muzic playing on speakers)
(At night it goes into the moon, and goes down to Anne and her friends. Suddenly, it goes into the first 2 seconds of the intro. Anne wakes up on the same room from the ending of the previous segment)
Anne: (screams, gasps) Guys, guys, guys. I just had the craziest dream. I was trapped in a world of frog pe-- (turns to find the Plantars looking at her) Oh.
Hop Pop: (croaks)
Anne: (hugs her legs) Right.
Sprig: Hey, Anne. Sleep good?
Hop Pop: Careful, boy! It could be hungry.
Polly: For your guts!
Anne: Dude, relax. I am not gonna eat something that clearly doesn't bathe.
(Flies buzz around Hop Pop, shown close-up to be incredibly dirty. He eats a fly.)
Hop Pop: Fair point.
Sprig: See? Told you it was harmless.
Hop Pop: Hmph. For now.
Polly: Just give me an excuse to use old Doris here.
Anne: I think the little one wants to kill me.
Sprig: Yup. So, you must be so excited to be trapped in another world. Very jealous. Oh!
Anne: (chuckles) It's not all that. I miss my home and my stuff and especially... my friends. Without them, I just feel kind of lost. You know?
Sprig: Well, then, why don't I be your friend in the meantime?
Anne: You?
Sprig: Me!
Anne: You.
Sprig: Come on. It'll be fun! What did you do together?
Anne: Everything. Marathon dumb TV shows, drink boba till we vomited, hung out at the beach.
Sprig: Oh, we've got a lake. Would going there with me make you feel less homesick?
Anne: Hmm. (Looks at her photo, then Sprig)
Sprig: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Anne looks at the photo again) Is gon' be great.
Anne: (giggling) I like your moxie, frog child. Let's do it!
(In one quick montage, Anne gets ready and emerges from the bathroom wearing swimming attire.)
Sprig: You ready to go?
Anne: Yeah-ah!
Together: Hey, hey, hey! (Just before they reach the door, Hop Pop stops them.)
Hop Pop: And where do you two think you're going?
Sprig: We're going to the lake. Ooh. Ow.
Anne: Why? You want in? You wanna come?
Hop Pop: Absolutely not! Look, Anne. You're a new, unsettling, strange, bizarre, gangly, horrifying--
Anne: Thanks. I got it.
Hop Pop: Point is, the frogs in this town can be pretty small-minded.
Frog: Oh, hey, Hopediah.
Hop Pop: And paranoid. We just need to give 'em time to get used to ya. I think it's best you stay put. (He locks the door.)
Anne: But--
Hop Pop: No buts. Now I'm gonna go into my study to get a little reading done.
Sprig: Uh, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Don't do anything stupid! (He slams the door.)
Anne: Ugh! Adults are all the same. Curfews. Rules. Old.
Sprig: Yeah, looks like we're stuck here. Ooh! I know what'll be fun. Let's try some of Hop Pop's pain peppers. So hot, they'll make you wish you were dead. (humming) (screaming) Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! (gurgling) Someone just kill me, please! Bleh. Your turn.
Anne: No, thanks. I'd rather go to the lake.
Sprig: Ahh-- What? But Hop Pop said, uh--
Anne: Sprig, you wanna know the best thing about friendship? When you got your friends by your side, anything is possible. Whatever you want, a real friend will help you get. And you know what I want?
Sprig: The lake!
Anne: Yup. Now let's go rob an old man!
Sprig: Ew.
Anne: Yeah, that didn't sound as cool as I wanted it to.
Anne: Any ideas?
Sprig: Ooh! What if we use fishing line to lower me from the ceiling? Then I grab the key right out of Hop Pop's pocket. I'll move like a shadow.
Anne: (gasps)
Sprig: Shadows knock things over sometimes.
Anne: Do you hear that?
Hop Pop: (snoring)
Anne: No way. This might be the creepiest thing I've ever seen.
Sprig: Happens all the time. He makes a great scarecrow.
Anne: (sniffs) Know what this smells like?
Sprig: (inhales, blubbering as he licks the key) A key that's been in an old man's pocket?
Anne: Freedom!
Sprig: That was my next guess!
Anne: (sighs) This is great. Two pals beatin' the odds to have some fun. Here. Smile! Whoa. Hey, that turned out great.
Sprig: I don't know what's crazier, that you just stole my soul in a tiny box, or that we look so incredible. I gotta say, this friend business is amazing!
Anne: Didn't you have friends before I showed up?
Sprig: Uh...
(giggles)
Little frog: Your turn.
Sprig: Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Check this out! Aaah!
(both screaming)
Sprig: Aaah! Help! It's eating me alive!
(screaming)
Sprig: Ha-ha! I'm just kidding, guys. Aaah! Aaah!
(screaming)
Sprig: Kids around here don't really get me.
Anne: Well, hey, they are missin' out. Come on.
Sprig: So, is punching part of friendship?
Anne: Absolutely.
Sprig: We made it.
Anne: Whoa. It's beautiful. You ready, dude? Yeah! Whoa-ho!
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Anne: Oh.
Sprig: Oh. This was not here last week.
Anne: Huh. Hmm. I know exactly what's going on here. Some jerk just wants this beautiful lake all to themselves. Well, forget that.
Sprig: Ah, I don't know, Anne. Whoever wrote this wrote it in a hurry, like they were scared to be here.
Anne: Or maybe they just had bad handwriting. Come on. Don't be a buzzkill. Ooh, that's nice. Hey, what are you doing?
Sprig: Something's not right here. Let's just go back.
Anne: Ugh, I thought you were trying to be my friend.
Sprig: I am.
Anne: Well, this is what friends do. Remember? They help each other get the things they want.
Sprig: Huh?
Anne: Look, if a friend likes a pencil case, you get it for them. If your friend likes your new shoes, you give them to her. And if a friend wants you to steal a crazy music box from a thrift store, even if you don't really want to, you do it, okay? Because if you don't, they might not want to be your friend anymore.
Sprig: Fine.
Anne: Fine.
Sprig: (panting) Whoo-hoo!
Anne: Ah, yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about! Cannonball!
(both laughing)
(water skipper whinnying)
Anne: Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: Yeah!
(chuckling)
Anne: Uh...
Sprig: I was blinking, wasn't I?
(screaming)
(roaring)
Anne: Stupid non-webbed human hands.
Sprig: Anne! (grunts) Ah. That explains the sign.
Anne: Sprig, I'm just slowing you down, buddy. Get out of here. This was my fault anyway. I should have listened to you.
Sprig: Friend punch!
Anne: Ow! Hey.
Sprig: Never! I'm not about to let my first real friend get eaten. We're in this together.
Anne: Uh, any ideas? Ah! What are you doing?
Sprig: I have a plan. Stand up!
Anne: Uh, okay.
Sprig: When I count to three, duck.
Anne: What? Are you crazy?
Sprig: Just trust me. All right. One, two... three!
Anne: Sprig! Vengeance! Take this and this! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! (Shw's thrown into the lake. She gasps when the water snake appears above her, only to start emitting smoke from its mouth and spitting a screaming Sprig out.)
Anne: You're alive. What did you do?
Sprig: (pulls out a pain pepper) So hot, they'll make you wish you were dead.
Anne: You little genius, you.
Sprig: And it looks like he couldn't take the heat.
(both laughing)
(roaring)
Anne: Run!
Sprig: Death approaches!
Hop Pop: (sighs, mumbles) (gasps) I'm up! I'm awake! The key. It's gone! Oh, no. Did they get out? Is the town rioting? Are they dead? Has Anne eaten the kids, THE WHOLE TOWN? (panting) What's this now? It's still locked.
(dice rattling)
Anne: Come on. Mama needs a new pair of shoes. Seriously though, I do need new shoes.
Hop Pop: You guys been here all day, huh?
Anne: Yeah, dude. I'm on a winning streak.
Sprig: I owe her my first-born child.
Anne: Oh, by the way, Hop Pop. We found this on the floor. You must have dropped it.
Hop Pop: Dang shallow pockets. Well, you get what you pay for.
Polly: Aha!
Anne: 'Sup, Polly?
Polly: You're not gonna eat us, are you? You're not even gonna try. Dis... appointing.
(sighs dramatically)
Anne: Hey, sorry I almost got us killed today.
Sprig: Are you kidding? That was the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me! My heart was beating faster than a dragonfly on a sugar rush. In fact, I'm feeling a little... sleepy. (snoring) (croaking)
Anne: Sasha, Marcy, I hope you guys are okay, because I am.
(Meanwhile...)
Captain Grime: Take a look at this please, Sasha. It was found far from here, in the South Forest. Now we know that you've been lying to us. (shows an imprisoned Sasha) Now we know that there are more of you.
(thunderclap)
(At the Plantar Farm, Sprig is looking at Anne's stuff.)
Sprig: Wow, Anne, look at all your cool stuff! What's this? (He picks up a toenail clipper.) Ah, I get it. Torture device.
Anne: That's a toenail clipper.
Sprig: Oh, okay, okay, sure. Oh! How about this? (He holds up a bike pump.) What does this do? (He pumps air into his mouth and speaks with a muffled voice.) It's painful. (The air hisses as it comes out) Oh, and this. (He clicks a cat pen.) Oh, I love this. This is amazing.
Anne: You know what? You can keep it.
(A bell's clanging is heard from upstairs.)
Hop Pop: Kids! Chow time! (In the kitchen, Hop Pop is serving a meal. Anne and Sprig bang their fists on the table while Polly flaps her arms.)
Kids: Time to eat! Time to eat!
Hop Pop: Hold on, you kids. Hold on.
Kids: Time to eat!
(Hop Pop hands out everyone's food, and Anne is immediately put off by it.)
Anne: Ugh! Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna pass. (She gently pushes her bowl ahead.)
Hop Pop: Why? Is my food not good enough for the princess?
Anne: Well, if I'm the princess, then you're the king of bad cooking. (chuckles)
Sprig: Ohhh!
Polly: Oh oh oh!
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah? Well, you... I...
Anne: What's the matter, Hop Pop? Frog in your throat?
Polly: Ohhh!
Sprig: Oh, she got you again!
Hop Pop: Oh, dang it! You know what? I'm gonna take a nap. I don't believe this. I feed you, I house you, and this is how you repay me? If you don't shape up soon, Anne, I'm throwin' you out! (He slams his bedroom door and a flower vase falls down.)
Anne: Yeesh. What's his problem? (She grabs a cane and hunches over speaking like an old man) I'm Hop Pop, and I cook bad and have a temper problem!
(laughing)
Sprig: That's so Hop Pop!
Anne: Eat your aphids, don't play with them. Elbows off the table!
(both laughing)
Anne: Sometimes I wonder why I even bother putting up with you at all!
(She breaks the cane; Sprig and Polly gasp.)
Anne: Oopsies. Guess I don't know my own strength, right, guys? You guys okay? What's the big deal? It's just one cane.
Sprig: That wasn't just any cane. It was Hop Pop's special cane, passed down from his father, Hop Poppity Pop, all the way from his father, Hop-and-Lock-Drop Soppity Pop.
Anne: Oh! You guys gotta help me. He's gonna kick me out the second he finds out about this. I cannot go back to living in a cave!
(A flashback begins with a thunderclap. Anne is curled up on the cave floor as dozens of bugs surround her. Water falls on her face.)
Anne: Uhhh! The nights were the hardest.
Sprig: Don't worry, Anne. We'll do whatever it takes to help you.
Polly: Eh, count me out.
Sprig: Polly!
Polly: What? I hardly know her.
Anne: Would you help me for one of these? (pulls a candy bar out of her pocket)
Polly: (gasps) Candy from another world? Lady, you've got yourself a deal.
Anne: Glad to hear it. Now, let's try to save my skin.
All: Yeah!
Anne: Okay, maybe we can't fix it, but someone else can? Someone good with... wood?
Sprig: Anne, you're a genius! We'll just take it to Leopold Loggle, the woodsmith. He loves wood. Almost a little too much.
Loggle: Uh-huh. Oh, oh, yes. Well, aren't you fascinating? Yes, you are.
Anne: Can you fix it?
Loggle: As a matter of fact, I can... not.
Sprig: Huh. Can you make a new one?
Loggle: Absolutely... no way.
Polly: Do you have one we could buy?
Loggle: Of course I do... n't. I don't.
Anne: Why do you keep doing that?
Loggle: Old smithing accident. You don't want to know.
Anne: Uh, okay, so--
Loggle: Tripped on an anvil. Landed neck-first on a metal pipe. Pierced my voice box clean through!
Polly: Blegh!
Anne: Dude, come on!
Sprig: Cool.
Loggle: Switched over to wood after that. Anyhow, I'm afraid I can't do much for you. That cane was made with wood from the incredibly rare, extremely dangerous Doom Tree!
(all gasp)
Loggle: Few have made it to the Doom Tree alive, fewer yet returned. It holds many secrets that mortals dare not--
Anne: Dude, it's a tree. Just tell us where it is.
Sprig: Yeah, Loggle, cut the chitchat!
Polly: You're bald!
Loggle: Okay, okay. I got a map to the Doom Tree right here, but it'll cost ya.
Anne: Click. (takes a picture with her phone; shows it to Loggle)
Loggle: Or you could do that for free.
Anne: Come on, guys. We gotta hurry. Hop Pop could wake up at any second!
Both: Right!
Loggle: Be careful, you kids. It's cursed, I tell ya. Cursed!
Anne: To the Doom Tree, everyone.
Polly: Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: Yeah! Whoa, Loggle. We gotta talk about this, man. We're comin' back. We're gonna talk about this. All right, good-bye.
(beeping)
(tires screech)
(beeping continues)
(bird screeches)
Anne: (grunting) Hold up. We're here. Now, that is an ugly tree.
Sprig: Just one of Mother Nature's horrible mistakes.
Polly: (chuckles) Frogs died here.
Anne: Look. That branch is perfect. (grunting)
Polly: You people and your legs.
Anne: (grunting)
Sprig: (spitting)
Anne: Careful. The tree is cursed. Pfft! (laughs)
Sprig: (laughs)
Anne: Okay, seriously though, on three. One, two...
(shrieking)
Anne: Uh, did the tree just scream?
(Doom Tree roars)
Sprig: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(grunts)
(roars)
(roaring)
Sprig: Oh, hey, it's maple.
Anne: Run!
(all screaming)
(shrieking)
Anne: That thing is not a tree. It's some kind of grody bug!
Sprig: A bug that wants to kill us!
Polly: Less talky-talky, more runny-runny!
(roaring)
Sprig: (grunting) Whoa! (grunts) Waaah!
(shrieking)
(groaning)
Anne: (screaming)
(grunting, panting)
(shrieking)
Loggle: (sighs) Well, Loggle, another day, another step closer to bankrupt-- Eh?
(Anne shouts)
(roaring)
Loggle: What the-- What's going on?
Anne: Don't ask questions!
(all scream)
(Doom Tree roars)
(all screaming)
Anne: What's it gonna take to get rid of this thing? (grunts)
(shrieking)
Anne: (grunting)
(bell rings)
Anne: Oh, this is nice. (grunts)
Leopold Loggle: That took 20 years to carve.
(shrieks)
(puzzled shriek)
Polly: Yah! Yah yah yah yah yah! And that! And that! Hi-yah!
Anne: (grunts) Charge!
Sprig: Charge!
(squealing)
Sprig: I'm gonna sand your face!
Polly: Phew.
Anne: Termites! Why would a woodsmith have termites?
Loggle: I'm a complicated man!
Anne: Incoming!
(squeals)
(grunts)
Polly: Uh...
Sprig: Cool.
Anne: This world is messed up.
(whimpering)
Anne: Up top!
Sprig: We did it!
Polly: That was awesome, you guys!
Anne: Now, let's get this cane back to Hop Pop.
Loggle: Give me that!
Anne: Hey!
Polly: What gives, Loggle?
Loggle: I'll tell you what gives. This doesn't even begin to cover the damages you've caused to my shop. You're gonna have to give me something else. Come on. Pony up.
Sprig: (sigh) Will this work?
Loggle: What? What is this, uh...
(clicking)
Loggle: Oh. (clicking) Oh! I like this. You can go.
Sprig: Sorry, Anne. After all we worked for too.
Anne: It's okay. We'd better head home. Hop Pop's probably already awake and furious.
Polly: Probably a bad time to bring this up, but I still get the candy, right?
Hop Pop: (yawns) Whoa, boy. I needed that. Hope nothing happened while I was asleep to make me mad again. Oh, no. What did you do?
Sprig: What's up with canes? Who even needs them these days, am I right? Ow.
(sighs)
Anne: I'm really sorry, Hop Pop. I was goofing around, and I broke your favorite cane.
Hop Pop: You what?
Anne: I know, I know. I'll show myself out.
Sprig: We'll come visit you, Anne. We promise.
Polly: (crying) And just when I was starting to like you!
Anne: Don't make this harder than it is.
(kids bawling)
Hop Pop: What the-- What's going on?
Anne: You're throwing me out. You know, like you said you would.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Mmm. Anne, truth be told, I was never gonna throw you out. I was just talking tough so that you'd show me a little bit more respect.
Anne: That's kinda messed up, man.
Hop Pop: Heh heh heh. (inhales) Yeah. I probably was a little bit too harsh. But I only did it because you remind me of myself when I was your age. Rough around the edges. Now, put that bag down, young lady. You're not going anywhere.
Sprig: Whoo! Yeah! I like that.
Polly: Yeah! I wasn't worried.
Anne: Thanks, Hop Pop. So you're not mad about the cane?
Hop Pop: Oh, I'm furious about the cane. You're on dish duty for a month!
Anne: Ugh. Yes, sir!
Hop Pop: Now that that's settled, I wrote a long list of comebacks to get you back for this morning. (clears throat) "Hey, Anne, is that your hair, or is it a dandelion?" Ha. (sniffles) Uh-- Oh. Are those long, lanky limbs, Anne, or are those, uh, twigs? Ah! (chuckles) Eh...
Sprig: (coughs)
Hop Pop: The moment has passed, hasn't it?
(The episode starts with Anne and Sprig at the Plantar's front yard. Anne is holding a tennis racket.)
Sprig: You ready?
Anne: You set 'em up, and I'll knock 'em down.
Sprig: Okay. (He digs under the ground.)
Anne: (Waiting) Come on. Come on!
Sprig: Coming at ya. (He brings out a large fly. It comes towards Anne.)
Anne: Backhand! (She swings the racket onto the fly, making it fly away.)
Sprig: (As he pops out from the ground) Nice swing!
Anne: I was on varsity.
Sprig: I have no idea what that means.
(Both perform their own handshake, then laugh.)
Wally: (Playing his concertina) A frog child and a monster from the woods getting along? So unnatural. (He plays an unusual note.)
Anne: Pssh! Of course we get along. We're Sprig and Anne.
Sprig: Anne and Sprig.
Anne and Sprig: (pose with Sprig standing off Anne's hip) Spranne against the world!
Wally: Disgusting. (He keeps playing his concertina and walks off.)
(Suddenly, Hop Pop screams from inside the house.)
Anne: Was that Hop Pop?
Sprig: Sounds like he's in trouble. We're coming, Hop Pop! (They run into the house, then into Anne's room.) Hop Pop! Hop Pop!
Anne: Whoa! What happened in here? (It is revealed that the whole room flooded.)
Sprig: Hop Pop? (Hop Pop pops out of the water.)
Hop Pop: (screaming) Stay back! Darned burrow bugs must have chewed the water pipes!
Anne: My room! My stuff!
Hop Pop: (Putting Anne's bag on the stair) Don't worry, Anne. I saved your stuff. Except your bed. And your blankets. And your pillow, pencils, T-shirts, hairbrush.
Anne: Just how long till it's fixed?
Hop Pop: Well, gotta find the leak, then patch it up good.
Sprig: Oh, let me help!
Hop Pop: Oh, no, ya don't! This here's river water. No tellin' what creepy critters are swimmin' around. (A river lamprey reveals its eyes above water and then swims again.)
Anne: Uh, so where am I gonna sleep?
Hop Pop: Well, the living room ain't no palace, but the couch is comfy.
Sprig: Uh, hello. (Swinging his tongue to Anne) Anne can bunk with me in my room. How fun will that be?
Anne: Roommates? Heck yeah! (They bump each other.)
Hop Pop: I don't know. Bein' friends is one thing, but roommates? Ya think ya know someone until they're in your space and you're in theirs, and ya can't stand how they whistle all the time, and they complain whenever ya clean your web crusties out. (yelling) "Yes, I have to do it in our room! It has the best lighting!" (back to normal) My point is-- (He sees that Anne and Sprig have already left.) And they're gone. Mark my words though. No good will come of this. No good at all. (He sinks into the water.)
(Sprig opens the door to his room.)
Sprig: Here we have it.
Anne: Whoa. (Seeing Sprig patting her pillow) Awesome digs, Sprig.
Sprig: Thanks. I'll give you the grand tour. Let's start with the crown jewels.
Anne: Oh, cool. A doll collection.
Sprig: (chuckles) No. These are my action figures of the Great Battle of--
Anne: Incoming! (She hits Sprig with a pillow.) Oh, sorry, dude.
Sprig: What was that?
Anne: What? Haven't you ever had a pillow fight before--
Sprig: (As he hits Anne back) Heads up!
Anne: Oh, it's on!
(The two then have a fun pillow fight.)
Sprig: It's fun 'cause it doesn't hurt! (being hit) Ow! (He swings the pillow and almost drops one of his action figures.) Oops! Just gonna move General Bogbreath safely over here.
Anne: Yeah, gotta keep that doll out of harms way-- (Being hit in the stomach) Ooh!
Sprig: Time in! (The fight continues.)
(Cut to their sleep time. Night 1 begins)
Anne: So, Sprig, would you rather sweat melted cheese or always smell like skunk?
Sprig: Uh, sweat melted cheese. Frogs don't sweat, so I'd be cheese-free.
Anne: Frogs don't sweat? Uh, jealous! Okay, next question. Sprig? (She spots Sprig sleeping.) Psst! Sprig? Sprig? Sprig? Sprig, Sprig, Sprig. Hey, Sprig! (She throws a pillow at him.) You awake?
Sprig: Oh, yeah, totally.
Anne: Okay, good. So, next question.
(At midnight, Anne starts to sweat.)
Anne: Mm! Uh! Melting. (She opens the window and the wind blows in.) Ah, better.
Sprig: (feeling cold) Uh, freezing. (He closes the window then goes back to sleep.)
(Anne spots that and glares at him.)
(The next morning at the Plantar's house, Hop Pop kicks Sprig's bedroom door open while carrying Polly.)
Hop Pop: Rise and shine, sleepyheads! Ya missed breakfast!
Anne: (Facing upsidedown, groaning) Go away.
Polly: (As she pumps onto Sprig and wakes him up) First time I've ever seen you sleep in so late. What gives?
Sprig: I froze solid in the night and finally just thawed. (He unfreezes himself.)
Anne: What? It was like a swamp sauna in here. Maybe Sprig just needs another blanket.
Sprig: Or maybe Anne needs fewer blankets.
Anne: Or maybe...
Hop Pop: Y'know, the couch is still free in case there's trouble in paradise.
Sprig: No way. Pssh. It's no trouble.
Anne: Yeah. We're the best roommates in the history of roommates.
Anne and Sprig: Spranne against the world!
Sprig: After you, best roomie.
Anne: (Getting out the room first) Why, thank you, also best roomie.
Hop Pop: (doubtfully) Hmm.
Polly: They're gonna eat each other alive.
Hop Pop: Oh, absolutely.
(Night 2)
(Anne turns on the light, reads a book and eats a snack loudly.)
(Sprig faces the wall and uses a pillow to cover his ears.)
(Night 3)
(Sprig sleeps while croaking.)
(The noise wakes Anne up. Then Sprig swings his tongue to her place.)
(Night 4)
(Anne and Sprig take turns to open and close the window.)
(Night 5)
(Anne turns on the light and Sprig growls.)
(Night 6)
(Sprig throws his wet towel on Anne. She then sees him cleaning his web crusties and shudders disgusted.)
(Night 10)
(Anne picks up her clothes but steps on a rollerskate and falls. The rollerskate hits the wall and almost drop Sprig's action figure until he catches it. They look each other and laugh awkwardly.)
Anne: Is that my shirt?
(At Anne's room, Hop Pop is still looking for the leak.)
Sprig: (Opening the back doors) Hey, Hop Pop. How much longer, ya think? Tonight?
Hop Pop: Not a chance.
Sprig: Oh, let me help, let me help! You know my underwater sight is better than yours. (He tests his eyes.) Eh? Eh?
Hop Pop: That's a bunch of malarkey! My eyesight's fine! (pauses) Who's that, Sprig? Anyway, don't you have chores to do?
(Sprig groans and goes away.)
Anne: (As she opens the main doors) Hey, Hop Pop, what's the ETA on things down here? Not that I'm in a hurry to move back in or whatever. (Hop Pop glares at her.) What? I'm just curious. A girl can't ask about her flooded makeshift bedroom without getting grilled? Sheesh.
(That night, Anne and Sprig enter his room exhausted.)
Sprig: (scoffs and yawns) Wow, what a long day. Goin' straight to bed, if I, uh, can get there without tripping over all these dirty clothes.
Anne: I think it's your wet towels on the ground that'll get in your way.
Sprig: (muttering) I can leave my towels on the floor of my room.
Anne: What was that?
Sprig: Oh, nothing, best roomie. Anyways, good night. (goes to sleep)
Anne: Hmph. (She looks through at her photos with Sprig and chuckles at each of them.) Oh. Hey, Sprig, would you rather have a splinter you could never get out or get bit by a giant mosquito once a day forever?
(Sprig grunts and shrugs. Anne then grabs a pillow and comes to Sprig.)
Anne: Hey, Sprig.
Sprig: What, Anne?
Anne: (excitedly) Pillow fight!
Sprig: No, wait, stop! Aaah! (He dodges but accidentally hits his action figure and breaks it apart.)
Anne: Oh, no! Y-Your doll-- Uh, I mean, action figure. (pauses) Spranne against the world. Right?
Sprig: (replying blankly) I have to go to the bathroom. (He exits the room while staring at his friend.)
Anne: (sighs, then complains) How is it still so hot in here?
(Sprig enters the flooded room and goes underwater.)
Sprig: Where's that darn leak? Come on! Come on!
(Anne enters the room and sinks underwater as well.)
(Both come out and take their breath.)
Anne: Oh, that leak has got to be around here somewhere.
Sprig: I know, right?
(Both gasp)
Sprig: What are you doing here?
Anne: I was, uh, uh, feeling like a nighttime swim. What are you doing here?
Sprig: Nighttime swim. As well.
Anne and Sprig: (blaming) You came down here to fix the leak! Yeah, well, so did you!
Sprig: I knew it! You just couldn't wait to move out!
Anne: And you just couldn't wait to get rid of me! If you wanted me gone, you should have just said so-- Aah! (She is being dragged down by a river lamprey.)
Sprig: (worriedly) Anne? Anne! Anne! Anne! Anne!
Anne: Something's got my leg!
Sprig: Hang on. I'm coming. (He ends up being dragged as well.)
Anne: Sprig!
(They are being caught underwater. Anne pushes a lamprey on a ladder and sets herself free. Sprig hits on another's eyes and swims above. Later, they are surrounded by two lampreys.)
Sprig: River lampreys! What are we gonna do?
Anne: They're too fast. We can't fight them underwater. (She sees her wet blanket and pillows floating.) Huh. Hey, Sprig. You set 'em up... (She takes a pillow and gives Sprig one.)
Sprig: You knock 'em down. (He swims into the water and distracts two fishes. He hits one to above water and Anne hits it. The two fishes then make a spinning attack.)
Anne: Come on. Come on. (She sees two fishes above water. Anne jumps on the bed and hits them.) Backhand! (The lampreys hit the wall.) Had enough, river losers?
Sprig: There's more where that came from.
(The lampreys sink underwater and dig a big hole at the bottom and suck all the water out.)
Hop Pop: What the heck's going on down here?
Polly: Some of us are (screaming) trying to sleep!
(Sprig and Anne defend themselves, only realize it is Hop Pop and Polly.)
Anne: Oh, uh, hi, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: So roommate thing didn't work out, huh?
Anne and Sprig: (sigh) Not really.
Anne: I just couldn't live with him! The wet towels, the heat, the humidity. The web crusties. (feels disgusted)
Sprig: The loud snacking. The freezing cold. Lights on at all hours. Guess Spranne really is a bust.
Anne: Yeah.
Hop Pop: Why? Because you're finally talking? Sharing a room doesn't make you friends. Being honest with each other does. In fact, if you ask me, you're better friends now than you were before.
(Anne and Sprig smile.)
Sprig: Of course we are!
Anne: Yes! Spranne is back and better than before!
(Both makes their own handshake, then laugh again.)
Polly: Aw, how sweet. So where's Anne gonna sleep then? Not with me. My bucket's for one.
(Cuts to the couch in the living room, where Anne can open the windows and sleep comfortably.)
Sprig: Here you go. Some super-loud snacks you can munch on.
Anne: Aw, thanks, Sprig.
Sprig: No problem. Anything else I can get ya?
Anne: All good. See you in the a.m.
Sprig: Okay. Good night.
(Anne finally can eat snacks and read a book on her own. But the quiet atmosphere with only the ticking clock noise makes her feel a bit lonely. She sighs, then sees a can with a spring connected to it.)
Sprig: (on the speaker) So, Anne, would you rather smell like rotten eggs or have hiccups every day for the rest of your life?
Anne: Oh, good one. I think I'd... (The living room floods.) Didn't anyone fix the leak?!
(The frog being carried by a dragonfly soars through the sky.)
Frog: Aah! Help! Somebody help me!
(Anne shows Sprig and Polly a video on her phone.)
Anne: And this bad boy is my kitty Domino.
(Domino meows.)
Anne: You guys would like her. She's got fire. Sprig: Ooh!
Polly: Aw, she's so tiny! I feel huge!
Sprig: Hmm. I will... (pulls out a hammer) set her free!
(Anne reclaims her phone.)
Anne: Please stop doing that.
(sizzling)
Anne: (sniffs) Ugh! What is that? Did something crawl under the house and die?
Sprig: (sniffing) Worse, Anne. Much worse. Hop Pop is cooking!
Sprig: Brace yourself.
Anne: Brace myself for what?
Sprig: Aah! (screaming)
(humming) Hop Pop: Mmm! (slurping)
Sprig: What's the plan this year, Hop Pop? Poison the competition? Ooh!
Hop Pop: The plan is to win.
Anne: Win?
Hop Pop: The annual village potluck. Every year we frogs gather for a great contest. The family who brings the best-tasting dish is showered with love and copper coins. The family with the worst-tasting dish spends the night in... (thunderclap)
Hop Pop: the shame cage!
Anne: Brutal.
Sprig: And guess which family ends up there every year.
(all three sigh)
Anne: If you think I'm gonna let my favorite froggy family end up in a cage, you've got another thing coming. I know I'm not technically a Plantar, but maybe I can help.
All: Mmm!
Sprig: Anne, we'd sure appreciate it.
Anne: So, what you making over there, Hop Pop? Sock gumbo?
Hop Pop: No, silly. It's a traditional recipe from my family's cookbook. We been using this baby since I was a pollywog.
Anne: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think I found your problem, guys.
(all gasp)
Anne: Old things are dumb!
(gulps)
Polly: Oh, that makes sense.
Sprig: It's all so clear now.
Hop Pop: But we Plantars have always cooked these recipes. What would my great-gam-gam say?
Anne: She'd say "Move on."
Hop Pop: (sighs) She was a fierce woman.
Anne: Look, if we're gonna win this thing, we need something new, something revolutionary, something no one in the swamp has ever seen before. Something like...
Sprig: (gasps)
Anne: pizza!
Sprig: Whoa.
Polly: I don't know what it is, but I love it.
Anne: Pizza is the ultimate dish. You haven't lived until you've shared one with your friends at the mall.
Hop Pop: Now, now, hold on. Before we get carried away, what about this tried-and-true recipe? Swamp mold pot pie!
Sprig/Polly: Pizza! Pizza!
Hop Pop: Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Sprig: We'll win for sure with this, Hop Pop.
Anne: Now all we gotta do is-- (clears throat) All we gotta do is get four ingredients-- dough, cheese, basil, and tomatoes. Are you guys ready to make our pizza dreams a pizza reality?
Sprig/Polly: Pizza dreams! Sprig: Oh! Oh! Maybe we should put pineapple on it. Seems like a natural fit. (groans as Anne pins him to the wall)
Anne: (whispers) Don't you dare talk about pineapple on my pizza. Ever. Okay. Let's go get those ingredients. Pizza dreams!
Sprig: (weakly) Pizza dreams.
Polly: (shakes Sprig) Pizza dreams!
(Flies buzz around a roll of flour as Mr. Flour, the baker, stomps on it before throwing it into his oven.)
Mr. Flour: If you want the dough, the boy has to marry my daughter.
(Reveals Maddie Flour with a voodoo doll of Sprig as ominous music is heard.)
Maddie: Hiiiii, Spriiiiiiig...
Mr. Flour: Ain't she adorable?
Anne: Done.
Hop Pop: You know, if we used a traditional recipe, we wouldn't have to sell Sprig.
Anne: No! That old book is old. Sprig's eternal happiness is a small price to pay for pizza.
Polly: Agreed.
Sprig: Aw, it's not so bad. Maybe we'll learn to love each other. Aah!
Maddie: I've seen your death in my mind.
Sprig: I was kinda hoping it'd be a surprise. (chuckles)
Maddie: (whispers) It will be.
(sinister chuckle, slowed down)
Anne: Congratulations on your new son. Now cough up the dough.
Mr. Flour: Yay!
Anne: Pleasure doing business with ya.
Sprig: Well, looks like we gotta go. (chuckles) See ya.
Polly: I wanna be the maid of honor!
Maddie: See you soon, hubby...
(flies clucking like chickens)
(all screaming)
(roaring)
Mrs. Croaker: Thanks again for helping me out! I know Brutus can be a handful.
(bellowing)
Sprig: What are we here for again?
Anne: Cheese!
Polly: (laughing)
Hop Pop: You know, there's a recipe in here that doesn't need cheese.
Anne: No old recipes! Huh? (panting) (gasps) Hey, Brutus! Over here! !Toro! !Toro!
(roaring)
Anne: (laughs) Oh, come on!
Sprig: Blah!
Anne: (grunts, sighs)
Anne/Sprig: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Brutus roars.)
Mrs. Croaker: Here you go, deary. A hunk of cheese made fresh from the milk of those ca--
Anne: Please don't tell me where it comes from.
Anne: Hey, careful with that basil, dude. We had to fight off like ten giant aphids to get it.
Sprig: Who knew ultimate flavor could be so painful?
Hop Pop: Almost lost my behind to those things.
Sprig: This is the price of progress, Hop Pop.
Anne: Exactly. And we've only got one ingredient left. Tomatoes. According to this, they should be up ahead.
Hop Pop: Still can't believe I traded my favorite dentures for that map.
Sprig: You know, I've never actually tasted a tomato. No one in town really sells them.
Hop Pop: There's a reason for that. They're in the "dangerous vegetables" section. It suggests we go for prunes instead. Can't go wrong with prunes!
Anne: Whoa-whoa. "Dangerous vegetables"? Come on!
(roaring)
Polly: Ho...
Sprig: ly...
Anne: ...tomato.
(roars)
Hop Pop: You know, this baby's got some great substitutes, all of which are delightfully harmless.
Sprig: Couldn't hurt to hear a few options.
Anne: Hold on! Guys, the shame cage isn't just in the town square. It's up here. You're not gonna change the world without taking a few risks. We need to be bold, groundbreaking, brave!
Hop Pop: Anne, there's a big difference between courage and stupidity! (screaming)
(roaring)
All: Hop Pop! (yell)
(Anne panting)
(all yelling)
Sprig: My fiancee was right! (all grunting)
Hop Pop: Holy smokes! Acid!
Anne: Well, at least the ingredients are safe. No!
(echoing)
Anne: The ingredients! Everything we've worked for!
Sprig: At least it'll be a quick, painless death.
Polly: Why would this be painless?
Sprig: Just let me have this lie!
Anne: (sighs) My revolutionary ideas were supposed to save you guys, not get you killed. I shouldn't have so stubborn. I just really wanted to share a pizza with you guys.
Hop Pop: Ah, I didn't care about that pizza stuff anyway. But you were really trying to help this family out, and that's worth something in my book.
Anne: Your book? That's it. Is there anything in the old ways that could help us right now?
Hop Pop: Well, I don't know. Nothing especially useful. Just that the throat of this giant tomato plant is absolutely delicious eaten raw.
(loud burp)
(gurgling)
(chomping)
(all yelling)
(all roaring)
(loud groaning)
Polly: (spits) Know your place, plant!
(bell tolling)
Anne: There isn't much time. Let's go home and make one of your old recipes, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Yup. But maybe we can spruce it up with something a little dangerous.
Frog: Yup. Still up here. Still need help.
Frog #1: Put it right over here.
Frog #2: Just a little touch of goodness.
Frog #3 A few more bug legs should do it.
Frog #4 Is that fly gonna say up there?
Anne/Hop Pop: Perfect.
(fanfare)
Mayor Toadstool: All right! Let the annual potluck begin! Let's get to tastin' those dishes. Mmm! That is "scrumptious." Oh! Ooh! What have we here? (chomping) Oh, that is delicious! Yeah! Excellent effort! And last, but not least-- (sighs) the Plantars. What filth have you cooked up this ti-- Hmm? Tomato? That's awfully dangerous. (chuckles) Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!
(drumroll)
Mayor Toadstool: Why, I do declare! This is the best dish the Plantar family has ever brought to a potluck!
Hop Pop: What?
(all gasping)
Sprig: What? Did we do it? Did we actually win?
Mayor Toadstool: Win? No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, it's better than usual, but it's still terrible. Last place, as usual.
(sad "wah-wah" theme plays)
Mayor Toadstool: You folks should know the way to the shame cage by now. Hurry along. All right, boys, light it up.
(all sigh)
Sprig: Cheer up, guys. Sure we came in last. Again. But thanks to Anne's new ideas and Hop Pop's old ones, we've done the best we've ever done.
Hop Pop: You know, he's right.
Polly: Yeah!
Anne: We did, didn't we? Uh, this is weird, but... any chance I could squeeze in there?
Hop Pop: How 'bout it, Carl?
Carl: The more the merrier.
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Hear that?
Sprig: Get in here, you crazy kid.
Anne: Whoo-hoo!
Carl: (grunting)
Anne: Well, if we can't share a pizza, at least we can share this. And you know, honestly, this isn't so bad... Hey, what the heck? What was that?
Sprig: Ooh, I forgot to mention the shame nuggets. (crowd jeering)
Frogs: You people should be ashamed!
Mr. Flour: Hey! That's my son-in-law!
Sprig: Hi.
Polly: Is that the best you got?
Hop Pop: (sighs) Tradition is such a beautiful-- Son of a slug!
(At the Plantar house, Sprig and Polly are doing dishes.)
Polly: (licking a fork) La-la-la-la.
Anne: Look, dude, all I'm saying is that where I'm from you could get arrested for having a couch this firm.
Hop Pop: Back in my day we didn't have furniture. We sat on rocks. Sharp ones.
Anne: Okay. But if I get butt blisters, I'm blaming you.
Hop Pop: Back in my day we called those "character".
(Shot cuts to the outside of the Plantar house.)
Anne: (groaning) So... heavy.
Hop Pop: Mind the flagstone.
Anne: (Trips on a rock and yells)
Hop Pop: Back in my day, kids spent less time complainin' and more time watching their step.
Anne: Yeah? Well, where I'm from people fixed their crummy houses.
Hop Pop: (gasps) This house is like family! You apologize!
Anne: To a house?
(Cut to Polly playing solitaire in the living room. A loud thud is heard.)
Anne: (offscreen) Where I'm from, we didn't rush people in the bathroom! (Another thud is heard)
Hop Pop: (offscreen) Well, back in my day we didn't have a bathroom! (Another thud)
Anne: (offscreen) Stop hitting the door with a battering ram!
Hop Pop: (offscreen) It's been two hours!
Sprig: (yells) I can't take this anymore!
Polly: They're just getting used to each other. It's not a big deal.
Sprig: Not a big deal? Do you remember the Henderson's next door? They used to argue all the time, and look what happened to them.
(Wally loots the Henderson's house which looks abandoned.)
Wally: Nothing like scavenging the remains of a broken frog family.
Sprig: If we don't do something now, it won't be long before their bickering tears this family apart.
Polly: I still think we should just give them time. Not like we have a lot of options. You can't force people to get along.
Sprig: (having an idea) Of course not, Polly. Of course not... Of course-
Polly: Just go already!
(Shot cuts to the back of the Plantar house.)
Hop Pop: (sighs)
(A flock of flies honking like geese fly pass.)
Sprig: We've been robbed!
Hop Pop: (shocked) Say whaaaaat?
Anne: (laughs) Sorry. Sorry. It's just that Hop Pop delivered the perfect sitcom catchphrase.
Hop Pop: Must be painful to make so little sense all the time.
Hop Pop: (gasps) My prize-winnin' corn!
Anne: You've won prizes?
Hop Pop: It's an expression, Anne. What are you, the fact police?
Sprig: The injustice! The outrage! We've gotta catch this thief!
Hop Pop: Agreed. And it's nice to see you so passionate about produce, Sprig.
Polly: Yes. Very odd.
Sprig: If the thief stole once, it'll steal again. The only way to catch this monster is a stakeout.
Polly: I like steak.
Hop Pop: Good idea.
Anne: Okay.
Sprig: And the only ones who can do it are... Anne and Hop Pop!
Anne: Say what?
Hop Pop: Huh?
Sprig: Well, I obviously can't... because I have the attention span of a... Oh, look at that.
Anne: Why not Hop Pop and Polly? Seems like a winning combo to me.
Hop Pop: Polly's a baby, Anne.
Anne: Just asking, Hop Pop. Ugh.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Very well. Let's be honest though. Anne'll probably fall asleep and it'll just be me.
Anne: Why would I fall asleep first? Aren't you like 100 years old? (She leaves and he follows.)
Hop Pop: I'm a crisp 68!
Polly: You stole the corn, didn't you?
Sprig: Oh, absolutely. But now those two have to spend the whole night together and bond!
Polly: Sprig, you can't manipulate people like this!
Sprig: I can, and I did. And it's going to save this family.
Sprig: (humming) Mm-hmm. (chuckles) Just look at 'em. And now to watch the flowers of friendship bloom.
Polly: (grumbles)
(crickets chirping)
Hop Pop: For goodness' sakes, Anne, put that lamp out. We're trying to catch the thief, not scare it away. Anne: (blows) (yawns)
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Had a feeling you wouldn't last.
Anne: Worry about yourself. I'll be fine. I just need a little boost is all.
(electric guitar riff)
Hop Pop: "Blam Berry Blitz. The drink that punches you in the face and doesn't stop." Hah! That silly drink won't keep you up! Now, this will keep you up.
Anne: (sniffs) Ugh! What is this poison?
Hop Pop: Mama's old gourd tea recipe. I'm not surprised you don't like the smell. It's way too strong for you.
Anne: Ha! No way it's stronger than my Berry Blitz.
Anne/Hop Pop: Gimme that!
Hop Pop: (gargling)
Anne: (groaning) (exhales) (groaning)
Hop Pop: (gasps)
Anne: Blech! (coughing)
Hop Pop: (coughing)
Anne: (laughs) You should have seen the look on your face. You were dying!
Hop Pop: (laughs) And what about you? I didn't even know you could turn that color. What, you got chameleon in your blood? (laughs)
Anne: (sighs) You know, sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get home.
Hop Pop: I know what it's like to miss something, Anne. I find myself pining after the good old days way too much.
Anne: Yeah. We're kinda similar that way. You're always going on about the old days, I'm always going on about back home.
Hop Pop: Yeah, deep down we're just a couple of softies, ain't we?
Sprig: It's working. They're... connecting.
Anne: Of course, my situation is way worse than yours.
Hop Pop: Always gotta make it about you, don't you? "I'm Anne, and my life is worse than everyone else's."
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, at least my head isn't a teakettle. Wait. What?
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah? Well, at least my hair isn't rainbow stardust.
Anne: What the--(groans)
Hop Pop: Uh... What?
Anne: Whoa!
Hop Pop: What's happening to us?
Anne: How should I know-- (sees the drinks flying around) Oh. The drinks! Our body chemistry must be so different that we're having crazy reactions to each other's extreme beverage. That was the smartest-sounding thing I've ever said.
Hop Pop: (tea whistling) This is terrible! I never shoulda let you trick me into trying something new!
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, your gross old mama's tea did this to me!
Hop Pop: (exaggerated gasp)
(Anne and Hop Pop argue again, no audible dialogue)
Sprig: No, no! This can't be! They're fighting again.
Polly (sarcastic): Oh, no. What a surprise.
Sprig: (grunts) Okay, okay. No problem. We'll just have to take matters into our own hands.
Polly: (gasps) Wait. You don't mean...
Sprig: Oh, that's right, Polly. I'm going to steal more corn right under their noses. They'll have to do this again tomorrow, and the next night, and the next night, until they're the bestest friends who were ever friends, and then the family will be saved! (sinister chuckle)
Polly: You're mad!
Sprig: Try and stop me! Ha-ha!
Polly: Oh, boy.
Anne: I didn't make you drink my Berry Blitz.
Hop Pop: Well, you grabbed for my tea first.
Anne: This wasn't my fault.
Hop Pop: Well, it sure wasn't mine.
(rustling)
Anne/Hop Pop: Huh?
(both gasping)
Anne/Hop Pop: The corn thief!
Anne: (coughing) Watch where you're pointing that thing.
Hop Pop: Sorry.
Polly: Hah!
Sprig: (groans)
Polly: Stop this madness!
Sprig: Aah! Let go!
Polly: You've lost your mind!
Sprig: A small price for saving this family!
Hop Pop: Hey!
Anne: Stop right there, you-- you... thief? Huh?
Anne/Hop Pop: Whoa.
Monster: (roars)
(both screaming)
(high-pitched whistle)
Monster: (inhales)
(screams)
Hop Pop: The corn thief! And it's the scariest thing I've ever seen!
Anne: Finally something we agree on. Hop Pop: We've got to take this thing down. Are you with me?
Anne: Till the end.
Hop Pop: Then let's do this!
Anne: Aah!
Hop Pop: Teakettle beam, fire!
Anne: (grunts) Rainbow magic!
Monster: (gasps)
(both groaning)
Monster: (groans) (sinister laughter)
Anne: Our attacks have no effect.
Hop Pop: But we can't give up so easily.
Anne: Right!
(both grunting)
(back to reality...)
Hop Pop: (groaning)
Anne: (meowing)
Polly: Well, they're broken.
(grunting)
(both imitating lasers firing)
Hop Pop: It must be immune to magic.
Anne: Quick! Grab those power-ups!
Sprig: Power-ups?
(both yelling)
(screaming)
Polly: Run, run, run!
(Sprig continues screaming)
Sprig: (gasping, panting)
Polly: Aah!
(both grunting, groaning)
Sprig: (groans) (gasping)
(Hop Pop, Anne yelling)
Anne: (groans)
Sprig: (screams) (yelling) No, no, no, no, no, no, no! (gasps) Anne, Hop Pop, it's me! I've learned my lesson. I promise.
Monster: (distorted voice) I'll never manipulate people--
Anne: Uh, does the corn thief kinda sound like Sprig to you?
Hop Pop: Now that you mention it.
Monster: (groaning)
Sprig: (sobbing) Don't kill me! Please!
Anne: Huh?
Hop Pop: Huh?
Anne: What?
Hop Pop: Uh, wai-- Wha-- None of that was real? But it was so terrifying!
(Sprig): Don't kill me! Please!
Hop Pop: I thought we were goners.
Anne: Me too. And you... defended me.
Hop Pop: And you stood by my side.
Anne: You know, Hop Pop, back home we call that having a friend's back.
Hop Pop: Well, back in my day we called it "pulling a Stinky McGuire." But if you don't know Stinky, the saying don't mean much, so let's just stick with yours. (both laugh)
Hop Pop: Boy, I'm tir--
(snoring)
Polly: Wow, Sprig, I owe you an apology. Your dumb ol' plan actually kinda worked.
Sprig: Thanks, Polly, but maybe next time we do it your way. (sighs)
Polly: (sighs) Guess I should drag them inside. But first, I'm parched. (gulping) (exhales) (grunts) All right, Boulder-tron, you ready to roll?
Boulder-tron: Always, my queen.
Polly: Good man, Boulder-tron. Good man.
(Anne and Sprig are outside, playing baseball with a watermelon gourd.)
Anne: (holds a makeshift scythe like a bat) Hey, batter, batter, batter.
Sprig: (grunting, groans)
(He throws the gourd. Anne swings and misses the gourd, while the scythe flies out of her hands )
Anne: (looking back) Ah, whiffed it. (gasps) Sprig!
Sprig: Huh? (gasps and ducks, the scythe flying over him into the woods. His hat falls apart, showing his orange hair.) Wanna go again?
Anne: Yeah-uh! (surprised) Wait, you have hair? Hey, sorry about your hat. Oh, there it is.
(meowing)
Sprig: (laughing) Hey, you found--
Anne: Shh. Do you hear something?
(meowing)
Anne: (gasps) Something's in trouble.
(panting)
(grunts)
(both gasp)
(The sound is the loud buzzing of giant wasps attempting to sting something stuck in a puddle.)
(grunting)
Anne: Oh, my gosh! We have to save her.
Sprig: Right behind ya.
(panting)
Anne: (grunts, grabs the small creature) Gotcha! (the stingers hit the ground around her) Oop, gotta go.
(grunting)
Sprig: Take that, buzz brains! Go sting someone your own size!
Anne: Let's go!
Sprig: Sprig out! Peace!
(panting)
Anne: You're safe now, little fella. (screams)
Sprig: What's wrong? Are you stung? We'll have to amputate.
Anne: No. This caterpillar looks exactly like my cat Domino from back home.
(meows, purrs)
Anne: I love my cat more than anything in the world. She was irreplaceable. But now I found a replacement. Let's take her home with us!
Sprig: Eh, I don't know, Anne. That's a wild animal. I'm not sure bringing it home is a good idea.
Anne: Pshh. That's ridiculous.
(purring)
Anne: My cat back home was a stray before I adopted her. All it takes is love and patience and... love.
Sprig: You said "love" twice.
(Anne holds the caterpillar near him and it licks him.)
Sprig: Sold!
Anne: It's settled. I hereby dub thee "Domino 2." Come on, girl. Let's go home.
Sprig: Uh, is it broken?
Anne: Hold up. I got an idea. This worked on Domino 1 without fail.
(rattling) (meowing)
Anne: That's a girl. You can do it. Come on.
Sprig: I want it. Give it to me.
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop, old buddy, old pal.
Hop Pop: What do you want, Anne?
Anne: Oh, nothin'. I was just thinking. Doesn't this house feel empty to you?
(Hop Pop turns and looks at the mountain of dishes Anne was supposed to clean.)
Hop Pop: Not especially.
Anne: Wouldn't it be nice to have a sweet, fuzzy, loving critter around?
Hop Pop: A pet?
Anne: Great idea, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: No pets! Every time we get one, Sprig and Polly swear they're gonna take care of it! Like this one spider we had, Charlie Bigbottom. I mean, sure, they were there for all the cuddlin' and the snugglin', but who gets stuck doin' all the work? Good ol' Hop Pop, that's who! I swear to Frog, whoever brings a fuzzy critter into this house will be on dung duty for a month!
Hop Pop: (trailing off) I told Charlie Bigbottom to stay out of the...
Anne: Plan B. We're gonna have to sneak Domino 2 inside.
Sprig: Should we be concerned about this? (lifts his leg, which Domino 2 is nibbling on)
Anne: That is called "play biting." Isn't it cute?
(slurping)
Sprig: Yeah, kinda seems like she's tasting me.
Anne: That's ridiculous. Trust me. I know cats.
Sprig: Well, all right, if you say so. (grunting)
Hop Pop: And how many times did I tell Charlie Bigbottom not to go up the chimney? And that little spider'd look at me with those big green eyes like he understood me. Two minutes later, where do I find him? Up the chimney!
(sneezes) (gasps)
Hop Pop: What's that?
Sprig: Uh, hey, Hop Pop, what's the worst thing Charlie Bigbottom ever did, since we're talking about Charlie Bigbottom?
Hop Pop: Heh! How can I even choose? Jumpin' out in front of Bessie and overturnin' the wagon. Gettin' tarantula hair everywhere. Then there was the time he put a hole in the roof.
Sprig: Where'd that happen again?
Hop Pop: You blind? The big hole right there.
Sprig: I don't see it.
Hop Pop: Right--It's right there!
(Anne chuckles)
(rooster crows)
Sprig: Anne, you awake? Anne? (gasps) Anne! Anne! Anne? Anne? Anne. Anne! Anne!
(snoring)
Sprig: Hey, wake up, wake up!
Anne: Huh? (She turns, and several scratches are shown on her cheek.)
Sprig: What happened? Are you okay?
Anne: Hmm? Yeah, totally. Domino 2 just had a bit of a rough first night indoors.
(yawns)
Sprig: Eesh. Hop Pop is definitely gonna notice something.
Anne: Oh, this is nothing. We just have to keep an eye on her while she's adjusting.
(meowing)
Anne: Isn't that right, Domino 2?
Sprig: Ah...
(chuckles nervously, shouts)
(muffled screaming)
Anne: That's just how she says "I love you." (kisses)
(meowing)
Anne: Aaah!
Hop Pop: (humming) Hmm. Oh, forgot the mustard.
(screams)
Anne: Ugh!
(buzzes weakly)
(meows)
(mouths words)
(hissing)
Anne: Uh...
(meows)
(Anne laughs)
Anne: (laughs) Whoo!
(meowing)
(laughs)
Sprig: Whew! Hope there isn't a Domino 3. (laughs)
(meows)
(purrs)
Anne: It's all worth it when you get to watch your adorable little boo take a nap.
Sprig: I gotta admit, she's pretty darn cute.
Anne: Welcome, brother, to the church of cute.
Sprig: This a cult thing? (stomach growls)
Anne: Whoa. Looks like Domino 2 isn't the only thing purring. Come on. Let's go grab some grub.
Sprig: Ooh, I love grubs.
(sighs)
Anne: Sleep tight, my precious baby angel.
Hop Pop: Whoa, whoa there! Hungry much?
Sprig: (with mouth full) We've been running around all day. We're starving.
Hop Pop: "Runnin' around"? Doin' what?
(gulps) (gulps)
Anne: Oh, nothing.
Sprig: I mean, who can say really?
(crash)
Hop Pop: What was that?
Anne: Mmm, basement ghost?
Hop Pop: Don't be ridiculous. Basement ghosts don't sound anything like that.
(all gasp)
Anne: What the heck is that? Domino 2, where are you? Baby precious!
Hop Pop: Wait. "Baby precious"? That's a pet name, for a pet! You sneak a pet in here?
Sprig: No. (grunts) Okay, we did!
Hop Pop: What'd I tell you about pets?
Sprig: Uh, I'm sorry. It's just that the caterpillar looked just like Anne's pet from back home. It was small, cute. It was black with white spots and it--
Hop Pop: Wait. A black caterpillar with white spots?
Sprig: Yes. Sensing something is wrong.
Hop Pop: That's a Coastal Kill-a-pillar! They're dangerous amphibivores, and they only get white spots right before they're about to--
(Domino 2 shrieks)
(roaring)
(all screaming)
Anne: Domino 2, is that you?
Hop Pop: Shh. These monsters respond to sound. Let's back away slowly and quietly.
Polly: (bangs the door open and yells) Hey, family! What's happening in here?
(roaring)
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Run, kids!
Sprig: I don't wanna die in a basement!
Anne: Domino 2? It's me, Anne. We bonded. I gave you treats. You gave me dead things. Don't you remember?
(purrs, roars)
Anne: Whoa! No, wait! Come back!
(Polly screams)
Hop Pop: Get outta here!
Anne: Guys!
(purring)
(Sprig, Hop Pop, Polly shout)
Polly: I would like to get off the ride now!
Anne: Oh! She's gonna bite their heads off as soon as she's done toying with them.
Anne: Toying with them. Wait a second.
(all grunting) (growling)
(all whimpering)
Anne: Hey, Domino 2! Over here!
(rattling) (yowls)
(meowing)
(screeching)
Anne: Oh, crud.
(panting)
(screeches)
(growls)
Anne: (sighs) Oh, Domino 2, I thought I could change you.
(growls)
Anne: But I guess I was wrong.
(hisses, growls)
Anne: I'm sorry I couldn't make it work. (sighs) It's time to go. (grunts)
(screeches)
Anne: Sayonara, Domino 2.
Hop Pop: And look who's cleaning up after the pet! Hop Pop, that's who!
Anne: (singsongy) Hey.
Sprig: Anne, you're okay!
Polly: Tell me that thing is gone!
Anne: Yeah, it's gone. (sighs) I'm so sorry, you guys. I had no right to put you all in danger, no matter how much I miss my cat. I hope you understand.
Hop Pop: Understand? Understand! I miss Charlie Bigbottom with all my heart and soul!
(bawling)
Hop Pop: Ohhh!
Polly: Uh, can we please fix the giant hole in the house?
Anne: (sighs) Well, just goes to show ya. You can't take some wild animal you found in the woods, have it live in your basement, and think everything's gonna be okay.
Sprig: I don't know. Sometimes it works out.
Anne: Ohhh! You're talking about me, right?
Sprig: Hey, um, made you a little something. I used Domino 2's hair balls as the fur. Here ya go.
Sprig: You hate it, don't ya? It's too ugly, isn't it? You know what, give it back to me--
Anne: I love it!
Polly: Whoa! (laughs) Whoo! (laughs) Higher!
(scream)
Sprig: Huh?
Hop Pop: Huh?
Polly: Aaah!
Anne: Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Look! (shows them her phone)
Polly: What are we looking at here?
Anne: "Suspicion Island". It's, like, my favorite show. I've got the new season and didn't even know it. It must have auto-downloaded before I got here.
Sprig: Who's this Otto?
Polly: And how did you download him?
Anne: Just watch.
(beeps)
Narrator: Previously on Suspicion Island...
Peruvia: I've got a lot of feelings about this place.
Sprig: Look! More Annes!
Polly: Ha ha! They have noses.
Randy: I feel like everyone on this island is suspicious, Peruvia, except you!
Peruvia: But, Randy, I think you're suspicious!
Randy: Nooooooo!!!
Narrator: Suspicion Island. If you don't stay suspicious, you won't stay alive.
(explosions)
Hop Pop: What is this demonic nonsense?
Anne: Hop Pop, this show's got beautiful people doing dumb things while stuff explodes! It's literally perfect.
Sprig: Awesome!
Polly: Let's do it!
Hop Pop: Now, hold on. Instead of that garbage, how 'bout I treat you to some real entertainment?
Sprig and Polly: Oh, no.
Hop Pop: A scene from The Shallow Pond.
(clears throat)
Hop Pop: Sadness. The world is sadness. But look. There. A pond! Is it deep? Or shallow?
Sprig, Polly, Anne: (chanting) Suspicion Island! Suspicion Island! Suspicion Island!
Hop Pop: Okay! Fine!
Anne: Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: Yes!
Polly: Yeah!
Hop Pop: But just one.
(Smash to Anne and the Plantars watching the show into the night; Anne, Sprig and Polly are engrossed, eyes bloodshot and veiny, while Hop Pop isn't interested.)
Chad: It can't be, Vivica. These pterodactyls are clones of... my dead brother!
Anne: (gasps) NO WAY.
(Hop Pop rolls his eyes and grumbles.)
(Vivica is taken away on a pterodactyl.)
Chad: NOOOOO!
Narrator: Will these beautiful teens ever make it off the island? Find out next time on--
(Anne pauses the video.)
Anne: And that's enough for tonight.
Sprig: Aw, come on!
Polly: (groans) This is torture!
Anne: Trust me, guys. You gotta pace yourself with this stuff.
Hop Pop: All right, you two grubs. Off to bed.
(both groaning)
Sprig: How am I supposed to sleep without knowing what happened to Vivica and Chad?
Polly: Stupid sleep! I wanna watch it right now!
Anne: So? What do you think, Hop Pop? Better than that boring stuff you read to us, right?
Hop Pop: That "boring stuff" is called literature, Anne. And maybe, if you had an ounce of culture, you wouldn't reject it in favor of your substandard, puerile garbage show!
Anne: Sheesh. Tell me how you really feel.
(yawns)
Anne: Nup, nup, nup.
(wind whistling)
(ticking)
(beep)
Narrator: Last week on Suspicion Island...
(Change to morning, a rooster crows.)
Anne: Come on, guys! It's time to get...suspicious.
(She starts to play the next episode; suddenly, her phone displays a low battery alert and beeps.)
Anne: Wait, WHAT?
(The Plantars enter.)
Sprig: What's wrong, Anne?
Hop Pop: What's all the ruckus?
Polly: Why you screaming?
Anne: My battery is low. But it was fine last night when I turned it off.
(She accesses the season. Somehow, all the episodes are marked "WATCHED".)
Anne: Huh? "Watched"? Who watched all these episodes and used up all the--
(Another alert.)
Anne: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!
(The phone then displays a dead cat face and is booted off.)
Anne: It's gone.
Sprig: What's gone?
Anne: Everything! My pictures! My texts! Videos of my cat! Now all my memories from home are gone!! (She begins hyperventilating.)
(panicked breathing)
Sprig: Um, there, there?
Anne: No! Was it you?
Sprig: What? No! I didn't watch anything. It must have been Polly.
Polly: What?
Sprig: I even heard her get up in the night. Very suspicious.
Polly: I needed to pee! Plus, if you heard me, you were awake too. You're the suspicious one!
Sprig: Don't change the subject.
Polly: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What about... Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Heh! Me? In case you forgot, I despise that garbage.
Polly: Exactly! Maybe you ran down the phone so we'd have to listen to your boring play!
Sprig: Oh, that's good.
Hop Pop: That is preposterous!
Anne: (groans) Enough! If none of you are going to admit to it, the least you could do is help me fix my phone.
Hop Pop: Fair enough, Anne. How do we bring this thing back to life? Magic? Live sacrifice? I know a guy in town--
Anne: We need power. Electricity.
Polly: What?
Hop Pop: Huh?
Anne: You know, zap zap?
Hop Pop: "Zap zap"? Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. Quickly! To my study!
Hop Pop: I've heard talk of a creature called the zapapede that lives deep in the Misty Peaks. It zaps its prey with a small spark of lightnin'. Yeah, it's pretty cool, actually.
Anne: Sounds like it's worth a shot. So, how far away is this bug, HP?
Hop Pop: Don't call me HP. (clears throat) It's half a day's travel, but that should be no trouble for this gang.
Sprig: Oh, yeah? Well, that's just what Chad Vanderblad said. Right before he was stabbed in the back by a backstabber on Suspicion Island!
Hop Pop: Watch where you're pointin' that finger!
Polly: I would never stab Chad in the back, but one of you two would.
Sprig: Hey! Every time you point, two fingers point back!
Polly: That doesn't make any sense!
Anne: Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! You're all suspicious. Just look at you. Now, come on. Let's get going. The sooner we move, the sooner I get my memories back.
(growling)
(grunting)
(grunting)
(growling, grunting continues)
(grunting)
Sprig:  A family Distrusts each other   On a dangerous mission   Like the nearly naked humans On the island of Suspicion   Peruvia, Felicia And Randy, so hot   Beguiling, hostile-ing   We're all Suspicious isle-ing 
Hop Pop: Quiet, boy. Look! There's one now! A zapapede!
Anne: Oh, looks pretty cute.
(creaking)
Hop Pop: Step lightly, everyone. This thing doesn't look like it can take much weight.
(grunting)
(Sprig continues grunting)
(yawns)
Hop Pop: Huh.
Anne: 'Sup, HP?
Hop Pop: Sprig sure looks tired, doesn't he? Awfully suspicious. And don't call me HP.
Polly: The old man's a lying snake, but he does have a point.
(creaks)
Sprig: You guys talkin' scum?
Hop Pop: What? No, no. No, no, no.
Sprig: Hmm. Psst, Anne.
(groans)
Anne: Excuse me, HP.
Hop Pop: (grumbles)
Sprig: I want to find out who's guilty just as much as you do. Let me help you.
Polly: Oh, no, you don't! You were trying to Chad her into trusting you!
Sprig: And you're trying to Vivica her into not trusting me!
Polly: Oh, and look at Hop Pop trying to Randy his way out of this.
Hop Pop: I don't even know what that means!
Anne: Guys, cut it out. You're gonna--
(all screaming)
(electricity zapping)
(loud crash)
(all groaning)
Anne: Rope bridge? More like nope bridge.
(groans)
Hop Pop: (gasps) Look! Down there! More zapapedes! They're pretty far down.
Anne: Hmm. Oh! Let's just link arms and lower someone down, just like the teens did in episode eight.
Sprig: Ha! So that Polly can drop us to cover her tracks, just like Vivica did in the very same episode?
Polly: You callin' me a Vivica?
Sprig: Maybe...
(shouts)
(Sprig grunts)
(blows landing)
Hop Pop: Kids, no! Stop fightin'!
(grunting)
(groaning)
(grunts, screams, shouts)
Anne: Hey, cut it out, you guys. Seriously. Ow!
Sprig: Oh, sorry, Anne. You okay? (chuckles)
(Anne shouting)
(gasps)
(blows landing)
Hop Pop: Kids, no! Stop fighting!
(grunting)
Hop Pop: Eh, no. (grunting) Oh. No. I-- It was me!
(echoing)
Polly: Say what?
Sprig: Huh?
Anne: You mean--
Hop Pop: That's right, Anne. I watched all the episodes. Every single one!
Anne: But you hated Suspicion Island!
Hop Pop: Hated it? Hated it?! I LOVED it!
(thunderclap)
Hop Pop: Ever since the end of that last episode, I-I couldn't sleep. I fell in love with those crazy kids on their crazy island. I couldn't get enough! I did the only thing I could.
Hop Pop: I snuck out to the livin' room to watch another episode.
(slurping)
(grunting)
Hop Pop: I vowed only to watch one, but Suspicion Island had its hooks in me! And before I realized what had happened, I'd finished the season!
(gasps) (rooster crows)
Hop Pop: With dawn approaching, I covered my tracks and made my escape.
Flashback Anne: Come on, guys! It's time to get...suspicious.
(thunderclap)
Anne: Unbelievable.
Sprig: What a twist!
Hop Pop: But now, I'm gonna make things right. I will redeem myself!
(screaming)
Anne: Hop Pop!
Hop Pop: I'm okay!
(zapping)
Hop Pop: You know, it's actually kinda relaxing!
(whimpers, screams)
(panting)
(groaning)
(pants, whimpers)
(screaming)
Sprig: He can't last much longer!
Polly: We have to work together!
(exhales)
(grunts)
Anne: Almost. Nearly there. Got him! Oh, wait a second.
(screams)
(screams)
(all screaming)
(sniffing)
(all groaning)
Hop Pop: Holy smokes. That's a lot of percents.
Anne: So, you love Suspicion Island, huh?
Hop Pop: Yeah... (sighs) And I'm sorry I lied and drained your memory box. Can you ever forgive this old, silly frog?
Anne: Dude, you just risked your life to recharge my phone. I think we're square.
Polly: Aw. Really glad I didn't push you off a cliff like I was planning.
Sprig: (laughs) Me too, Polly. Me too.
Hop Pop: All right, enough fiddle-faddling. We gotta get home so you guys can finish the season. If I don't talk to someone about it soon, I'm gonna explode! I mean, that part where the island itself is revealed to actually be--
Polly: No!
Sprig: Oh, come on!
Anne: Dude, spoilers!
(Anne and the Plantars are riding on Bessie.)
Hop Pop: Ah, a leisurely outing with Bessie. Why, we could really go anywhere. Do anything.
Sprig: Ooh, ooh! Can we get Swamp Slushies? They have new flavors.
Hop Pop: (laughs) Nope.
Polly: Can we go off-road? (She pulls Hop Pop's eyelids.) Do some crazy stunts?
Hop Pop: Double no.
Anne: Ooh, ooh! Can I drive?
Hop Pop: Sure.
Anne: Aw, come on, Hop Pop- Wait, really?
Hop Pop: Absolutely. I've been trying to teach this guy for years. (He points to Sprig.)
Sprig: It's true.
Anne: All right! Give me those reins. I'm ready to drive. (At the Plantar Farm, Hop Pop drops a big book on a tree stump.)
Hop Pop: Not before reading this, you ain't.
Anne: What?
Hop Pop: This is Bessie's History. Before touching a snail's reins, you gotta know them. Feel their heartbeat next to yours and become one.
Anne: Hop Pop, it's just a vehicle. We had a family car back home. It's no biggie. (Hop Pop throws the book at her.) Oof!
Hop Pop: Don't care. You can't drive Bessie, unless you read this cover to cover. And that's final.
Anne: Are there pictures?
Hop Pop: There are diagrams.
Anne: Noooooooo!
Hop Pop: Sheesh. Dramatic much? Now if you'll excuse me, Polly's due for a wash. (He picks up a dirty Polly from a mud puddle.)
Polly: No, no. Wait. No! I'll just get dirty again. You can't stop me! I learned this from watching you, Anne!
Anne: Ugh. I'll be old before I finish reading this thing.
Sprig: Yeah, page five is as far as I got. Too much description, not enough plot.
Anne: (sighs) This is ridiculous. I don't need history. (She puts the book in Bessie's bag and jumps onto her.) I need experience. Hey. What do you say we take a harmless test-drive? Prove to Hop Pop we're fast learners? (Sprig starts to take her hand, but stops.)
Sprig: Hmm. Do you get the feeling this is one of those decisions we'll look back on and say, "Ooh-boy, we probably shouldn't have done that"?
Anne:  We'll get Swamp Slushies while we're out. 
Sprig: (Jumping onto Bessie) No regrets!
Anne: That's what I like to hear. Hyah! (Bessie starts to move fast as Anne and Sprig whoop with joy. Mrs. Croaker is then seen riding her ladybug.)
Mrs. Croaker: Huh? What in tarnation? (She sees dust coming her way. Bessie rides past her very fast, causing her ladybug to spin out of control.) Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sprig: (Patting his bottom) Out of the way, slowpoke!
Mrs. Croaker: Hooligans! Ruffians! Swamp suckers!
Anne: Whoa. What was that?
Sprig: I've always wanted to try road rage.
Anne: And the verdict?
Sprig: Exhilarating.
Anne: Live your truth! Yeah!
(both laugh)
Sprig: Man, you were right. We didn't need to read some silly book. You drive just fine.
Anne: Just fine? Pshh. Boy, I'm a natural. (gasps) Ooh, ooh! Wanna take this baby off-road?
Sprig: Yup.
(revving)
Sprig: Whoo-hoo!
Both: Whoa!
(laughing)
Both: Whoa!
(laughing)
Both: Whoa! Oof!
Anne: (sighs) So, off-roading. Fun. But how about we go back to on-roading?
Sprig: Good old reliable on-roading, yes, please.
Anne: All right, Bessie. Let's move. (She whips Bessie, but she doesn't move.) One more time. Let's move. (Bessie still doesn't move.) Um, Bessie?
(sputtering)
Sprig: You all right, girl?
Anne: Hey, what's going on here? Does it need fuel in the tank or something? Is the oil low? Come get the tasty fuel, Bessie.
Sprig: Ew, Anne. These leaves are tastier. Here, Bessie. I got dem good leaves, girl.
(purrs)
Anne: Hmm. Maybe we can push her? Give her a jump-start? I'm sure that's a thing.
(both straining)
Anne: Okay. She is way too heavy.
Sprig: (panting)
Anne: Also, I'm crazy out of shape.
Sprig: What are we gonna do? We're stuck.
Anne: We have no choice. I'll stay here with Bessie while you hitch a ride back to the farm and... (groans) ... go get Hop Pop.
Sprig: Good idea. It's the right thing to do, even if we get an earful. Back in a flash (He uses his tongue to grab a tree branch and jumps from tree to tree.)
(sighs)
(scatting)
(yawns)
Anne: Ah, this is so boring. (groans) Wish I had something to read.
Anne: Fine. But just to pass the time. (coughs) Okay, let's see here. "It was an especially cold morning the day Bessie was brought into this world."
Hop Pop: (narrating) "The leaves had just changed color, and now I shall describe those leaves to you in great detail--" (Anne slams the book shut.)
Anne: Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
(grunting)
Sprig: Aha!
Sprig: Over here, over here. I need a ride.
(coughing)
(tires squeal)
Sprig: Oh, thank you so much for stopping. I, uh--
Sprig: Oh.
Mrs. Croaker: Bless my socks. If it isn't Sprig Plantar.
(barks)
Sprig: (chuckles) Yep. Hey, uh, sorry about earlier. Got a little carried away.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, pishposh. Sadie Croaker never holds a grudge, honey.
Sprig: Well, that's lucky. Will you give me a lift back home? It's urgent.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, absolutely.
Sprig: Thanks, Mrs. Croaker.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, my pleasure, honey. Well, go on and get comfy. Watch out for ol' Archie, though. His venom can cause paralysis. Now hold on to your eyebrows. 'Cause here we go! (She whips her ladybug and whoops with joy.)
Sprig: Whoo! (The ladybug moves very slowly.) Can't this thing go any faster?!
Hop Pop: (narrating) "And it was at that moment I realized Bessie was no ordinary snail, but a kind, clear soul who would help others at a drop of a hat. I raised my bid to 400 copper pieces, winning the auction, and in the process, saving Bessie from the nefarious Jim Snapes."
Anne: Yes! In your face, Snapes. (grunts) Man. This is actually pretty good. (She takes some leaves and chews on them.) And I need to stop eating leaves. (Meanwhile, Sprig is holding Archie while humming.)
Sprig: Come on, come on.
Mrs. Croaker: You know what would make this ride go a lot quicker?
Sprig: What? Anything. What?
Mrs. Croaker: A song! (vocalizing)  Ninety-nine jugs Of juice on the wall   Ninety-nine jugs of juice   Take one down, pass it around  (Back with Anne, she is still reading Bessie's History.)
Hop Pop: (narrating) "The snow swirled around us and I knew we were doomed. I could feel the strength leaving my body bit by bit. The sweet embrace of eternity crept closer and closer. Until suddenly I heard a sound pulling me back." (warbling) "Bessie... Bessie was singing!" (Anne starts sobbing.)
Anne: You go, girl. (She hugs Bessie's shell and her tears run down it.) You noble, noble creature. Man. This is messing me up. (sniffles) Now let's see. Where was I? (reading) "The reason Bessie had hidden in her shell was now very clear to me. A predator was close. And not just any predator. A natural enemy of snails."
(rustling)
(bird caws)
Anne: Uh... Hello? Uh, anything in here about this predator? Oh, there we go. Aw, it's actually pretty cute.
(snarling)
(screams)
(whimpers)
(snarling)
(yells)
(growling)
Anne: Cone on, come on. Yes!
Anne: (reading) "When Bessie senses danger, you gotta sit on her shell and yell at the top of your lungs, 'Bessie, things are getting messy!'"
Anne: Yes! Whoo!
(growling)
Anne: Eat our dust, hedgehogs.
(screams)
Anne reading: "If you still haven't escaped, give Bessie some berries from the secret compartment in the front of her shell."
Anne: Whoa, this is gross. Let's do this thing, Bessie.
(purrs)
(yelping)
Anne: Way to go, Bessie! You are the queen of the road.
(purrs)
Anne: All right, let's go home. (Bessie starts moving again. Back on Mrs. Croaker's ladybug, Sprig is lying down, fed up with the song she is singing.)
Mrs. Croaker:  Take one down Pass it around   No more jugs of juice On the wall 
Sprig: (sighs) Glad that's finally over.
Mrs. Croaker: One more time! (Sprig covers his face with Archie and screams.)
Anne: Hey, kid, need a lift?
(purrs)
Sprig: Anne! Thank goodness. Okay, bye, Mrs. Croaker. Thank you.
Mrs. Croaker: Bye, darlin'. Next time, try to keep that road rage in check. (laughs) Yee-haw! (She whips her ladybug and it takes off at high speed. Mrs. Croaker's cackling is heard.) Woo-hoo!
Sprig: Pretty sure I just got played.
Anne: That woman is everything I want to be. (It is dark when she and Spring return to the farm.)
Sprig: We made it. And it looks like Hop Pop's still washing Polly. (Polly, still dirty, is bouncing around the house.)
Polly: You'll never take me alive!
Hop Pop: Dang it, Polly. You're getting filth everywhere! (A crash is heard.)
Sprig: Hey. You coming?
Anne: I think I'm going to spend a little more time with ol' Bessie here.
Sprig: Suit yourself.
(door closes)
(purring gently)
Anne: Now where were we?
(snoring)
Hop Pop: (grunts) What the hey?
Anne: Good morning, Hopadiah.
Hop Pop: Anne?
Anne: I did it. I read the whole thing. In one night.
Hop Pop: Impressive. Kinda scary. But impressive.
Anne: I was wrong about Bessie. She's not just a vehicle. She's a noble, beautiful creature.
Hop Pop: And now that you've read this, all you need is experience.
(chuckling)
(evil laughter)
Hop Pop: I don't feel safe.
Hop Pop: Hmm. Got any threes?
Polly: I ain't telling you nothing, old man.
(From the basement, Anne's footsteps are heard; she kicks open the basement door and emerges, her face completely broken out in pimples.)
Anne: AHHHHHHH!!!!!
Sprig: AAGH!!
Hop Pop: IS SOMEONE DEAD?!!!
Polly: WHY ARE WE YELLING!!??!!
Anne: Just... look at me. (shows her breakout)
(The Plantars gasp.)
Sprig: She's diseased!
(They get out weapons.)
Hop Pop: We have to quarantine her!
Polly: Don't struggle, Anne.
Anne: What? No, guys, it's not a disease. These are pimples. It's just a human thing.
Hop Pop: Oh. False alarm, everyone. Just a human thing.
Sprig: (sighs with relief) Okay.
Anne: (sighs) Everybody already treats me like a monster. This is just gonna make it ten times worse. (groans)
Sprig: Ah, come on. No one treats you like a monster, Anne.
Anne: Are you kidding? I can't even go outside without making a scene.
(Flashback to Anne whistling as she walks through town.)
Villager: Ah! It's hideous.
Woman: Look away, Teddy. Look away.
Villagers: (screaming)
Anne: (saddened) Ah, poop.
(End of flashback.)
Sprig: Okay, fair point, fair point. But who cares what they think? We like you.
Anne: Uh-huh. I'm going to go hide in the basement until this clears up.
Hop Pop: Sorry, Anne, but nobody's hiding anywhere today. I need help at the vegetable stand. We got a bumper crop of scream beans that need sellin'.
(One bean screams. Anne slams her head on the table.)
(Cut to the market.)
Merchant: Fresh crickets, ma'am? Always fresh.
Merchant: Worms! We got worms!
Villager: Are these grubs organic?
(Cut to Anne, who has taken to hiding her face with sunglasses and a scarf which she adjusts.)
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Get out there and sell like your lives depend on it. Because they do. We-- We really need this.
Sprig: Come one, come all. Try the beans everybody's screaming about.
(screaming)
Anne: Beans, everyone. Wow, can you believe it?
Woman: Oh, gracious!
Villager: Like I'd buy beans from a monster.
Anne: Yup.
Frog child: (giggles) You can't catch me.
Anne: Whoa!
Villager: Leapin' larva! Look!
(All gasp)
Anne: No! No, don't look at me.
Villager: Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Villager: Yeah, I think so.
Villager: They're warts. Beautiful, ruby-red warts.
Anne: Wait. Huh?
Villager: Stunning.
Villager: Are they real?
Villager: I wanna touch them.
Villager: Amazing.
Villager: Three cheers for the girl with the ruby-red warts.
(cheering)
Villager: Yay!
Anne: Whoa! Whoa!
(giggles)
Anne: Whoo!
Toadstool: Oh, this is bad, Toadie. People hate us!
Toadie: With a passion, sir!
Toadstool: It's as if embezzling money from the town makes you the bad guy! (groans) If we don't fix things soon, we'll lose next month's election for sure. The only thing that can save us now is a miracle.
(cheering)
Toadstool: Hmm?
Toadstool: Oh, my dear Toadie, I do believe our miracle has arrived.
Sprig: This is awesome. Just look at all these gifts.
Anne: The townspeople like me. They really, really like me.
Polly: (gasps) Chocolate covered maggots! Come to Momma.
Hop Pop: Yeah. They really seem to like your human bumps, Anne.
Anne: (gasps) I better take care of these moneymakers if I wanna keep this up. (grabs a stick of butter and rubs it on her face) Babies. Babies are hungry.
(all shudder)
Anne: Too much?
(horn honks)
Toadstool: Anne, my dear. Care to join me for a joyride?
(whinnies)
Toadie: We brought the fancy snail.
Anne: Get out!
Sprig: We all get to ride in that? Awesome!
Hop Pop: Finally, the luxury I deserve.
Toadstool: Nope. I'm afraid only Anne is invited. Just look at those beautiful warts. (chuckles)
Anne: Don't look so glum, guys. It's just a ride. I'll be back in a few.
(whinnies)
Anne: Whoo-hoo!
(coughing)
Hop Pop: It begins.
Sprig and Polly: Huh?
Hop Pop: Fame changes people, kids. And not in a good way.
Anne: Whoo! Man, this snail is fast.
Toadstool: Anne, we can help each other. I can make sure you stay popular, and in turn, you can help me improve my reputation. How does that sound?
Anne: Sounds harmless. Can I honk the horn?
Toadstool: Yeah, sure.
Anne: Whoo!
(honks)
(crowd cheering)
(sighs)
(crowd cheering)
(cheering)
(screaming)
Toadstool: Here we are. From now on, Anne, this is your home.
Anne: Whoa! This is awesome. And to think just yesterday people were treating me like a monster. Look at me now, baby.
Toadstool: (chuckles) Glad you're enjoying yourself. Stick with me and I'll make sure you never go out of style. Now take care of those warts. Toodles.
Sprig: Hey, Anne. Got time for a visit?
Anne: Oh. Hey, guys. Just look at this place. Epic, right?
Sprig: Yeah. It's great.
Anne: (grunts) Can you believe I was living in your basement? Ha! It was cold, dusty, not to mention smelly. Oh, no offense.
Hop Pop: None taken.
(chimes)
Anne: Oh, shoot. We gotta wrap this up. I've gotta sign autographs, kiss tadpoles and do some interviews, all before dinner. So good to talk to you guys. Love you, mean it. Mwah.
Sprig: The heck was that? It's like she's a different person.
Polly: Yeah. A crazy person.
Sprig: This stinks.
Hop Pop: Hey. None of that. Kids, when one of your own makes it big, you support them. No matter what. Because deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down, they're the same person.
Sprig: (sighs) You're right, Hop Pop.
Polly: Okay.
Toadie: Ma'am, I think I found you the perfect dress for tonight.
Anne: Oh. Yeah, okay.
(The next day)
(crowing)
(knocking on door)
Anne: (groans) Five more minutes.
Anne(reading): Be at the assembly at noon sharp.
Anne: Good morning, my greasy babies. Time to get ready for the--(gasps) No. No. No, no, no, no, no. My pimples! What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? (gasps) Uh, hello? Anyone there?
Toadie: Just me. Toadie. (laughs) Wow.
Anne: Uh, can you deliver this note to the Plantars?
Toadie: Of course, ma'am. But before I do, could I get an autograph? I'm a huge fan.
Anne: Yeah, sure. Why not? Here. Now go.
Toadie: Uh, this is a little hard to read.
Anne: Just go!
Toadie: Yes, ma'am.
(footsteps retreating)
(sighs)
Sprig: We got your note.
Hop Pop: We came as fast as we could.
Sprig: What's the emergency?
Anne: My life is ruined. My zits. They're gone. Without them, I'm...I'm nothing.
Sprig: (sighs) Anne, that's ridiculous. I'm sick and tired of this and...and...(sighs) We'll do everything we can to help you.
Anne: Oh, thank goodness.
Sprig: Hmm. (muttering) I got it! What if we stuck some of these swamp berries to your face? They kinda look like pimples.
Anne: Great. But how can we get to the swamp without me being seen? I have f-Annes everywhere.
Sprig: F-what?
Anne: F-Annes. It's what we're calling my fans.
Polly: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
Hop Pop: Don't worry about the crowds, Anne. I have a pla-Anne.
(groans)
Hop Pop: Make way! Plague towels, everyone. Plague towels.
(all gasping)
Polly: If you don't wanna cough up your organs, stay back!
Villager: Hey, everyone, that's Anne's foot.
Anne: Uh-oh.
Sprig: The jig is up. Run!
(all screaming)
Villagers: Anne, we love you!
Villager: We need you. Please...
Anne: We'll never make it.
Hop Pop: Not without a diversion, we won't. Anne. Give me your shoe.
Anne: Uh... Okay.
Hop Pop: Hey, everyone. Lookie. I've got Anne's shoe.
Anne: Hop Pop, no!
Villager: He's got Anne's shoe.
Villager: Get him!
Hop Pop: Fly, you fools.
(crowd roars)
Polly: Eh, he'll be fine.
Sprig: Look, over there.
Anne: How do I look?
Sprig: That should do it.
Anne: Thanks for helping me, guys.
Sprig: That's what we're here for.
Polly: Not me. I'm here for the drama.
(crowd cheering)
Toadstool: Where is she? I'm losing a point in the polls every minute she's late.
Anne: I'm here. I'm here.
Toadstool: There you are, my dear. I was so worried.
Anne: Sorry, I was caught up in this whole mob situation. Luckily the Plantars were there to help me and--
Toadstool: The Plantars? Anne, honey, I thought we talked about this. Hanging out with those bumpkins will only pull you down to their level. I think it's for the best that you not be seen with them anymore. Understand?
Anne: Understood.
Toadstool: Good. Now get out there. Your public awaits.
(all cheering)
(feedback screeches)
Anne: Crazy week, huh? Couple days ago, I was a monster. And now I'm the pride and joy of Wartwood. I've got a nice apartment, f-Annes, fame. But you know what I'm missing? The people who'll stick with me whether I'm a monster or not.
(crowd gasps)
Villagers: She's hideous again.
Toadstool: Anne, what are you doing? You're throwing it all away? Now how am I supposed to convince these idiots to vote for me?
Toadie: Um, sir?
Toadstool: What is it, Toadie? I... Oh.
(coughs)
Toadstool: Did I say "idiots"? I meant lovely, lovely townspeople, eh? (chuckles) Uh, simmer down now. Simmer-- Whoa. This is an outrage! Stop that!
Villager: Show's over.
Villager: What a waste of time.
Villager: Let's get outta here.
Anne: Uh, hey, guys.
Sprig: These are horrifying.
Hop Pop: Yep.
Anne: Thanks for sticking with me, even when the attention got to my head.
Hop Pop: Just remember to do the same when I'm rich and famous.
Polly: Never happening.
Anne: Any chance I can go back to being the monster that lives in your basement?
Sprig: Of course.
Anne: Thanks, you guys. Hey, you know what? I still have the key to the apartment. You guys wanna try out the hot tub before they change the locks?
The Plantars: Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Hot tub.
Hop Pop: Can't wait to feel those bubbles in my pants.
Hop Pop: Hmm.
Sprig: I beat you once, I can do it again. I'll prove my way is right.
Hop Pop: We'll see.
Sprig: (grunts)
Polly: Let the final challenge begin!
(both screaming)
Hop Pop: The girls told me everything, Sprig.
Sprig: What? (yells)
Hop Pop: You're destroying the farm. Don't you see? Even if you win, you lose.
Sprig: (grunts)
Hop Pop: Ow.
Sprig: So I'm just supposed to go back to the way things were? You never listened to us.
Hop Pop: And I was wrong. I know now that you can't work together unless everyone has a say. Jeremy taught me that.
(both grunt)
Sprig: You... You mean it? I have to admit, most of my ideas were pretty terrible. I think we even caused permanent damage to the ecosystem.
Hop Pop: Yeah, but some of your ideas could work. We'll never know unless we try. I promise from now on to actually read your suggestions.
(all gasp)
Sprig: Promise?
Hop Pop: Promise.
(exhales)
Polly: And the winner is Hop Pop!
(sighs)
(grunting)
Anne: Phew. Think we could set up some shade out here, Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Great suggestion, Anne.
Anne: Thanks, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: And over there, I kept a small version of your swimming hole.
Polly: (laughing)
Hop Pop: Oh, and best of all, no more pit of fire.
Sprig: Thanks, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Thank you, Jeremy. Hmm. Nope. Hmm. Nope. Hmm. This one's a maybe.
Anne: Uh, hello? Anyone here? Well, this place seems nice.
Tuti: I help you?
Anne: (screams) Hi. Who are you?
Tuti: Am town healer, Tuti. Also part-time bounty hunter.
Polly: I like her.
Anne: Tuti, huh? Well, we're here for that full body massage.
Tuti: Full body is good. Come, we get personal.
Anne: Ooh! I'll go first. Whoa, you frogs are really flexible, huh? Are you sure you know how to massage a human?
Tuti: Is same.
Anne: (grunts and shrieks)
Polly: Whoa, mama.
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Anne(eyes watering): This is amazing. So... relaxing. Is that my foot?
Polly: And on that note, I'm out.
Tuti: Is done. You are reborn.
Anne: Polly, you are going to love this.
Tuti: Pollywog gone. You talk to no one.
Anne: (gasps) What? She ditched me? But this is all for her. (groans) I got to find her and get this thing back on track. See you, Tuti.
Tuti: Hmm.
(door opens)
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Afternoon, Tuti. Wonderin' if you've seen a couple of ol' scammers handing out these fake IOUs today.
Tuti: Scammers? Fake? (yells) Come. I lead way.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Fiery as ever, Tuti.
Wally: (burps)
Polly: (loud burp)
Wally: Dang, kid. You got the burp of a titan!
Polly: Thanks, Wally.
Anne: Hey! (panting)
Polly: Oh. Hey, Anne.
Anne: What the heck, dude? You ditched me? And now I find you rubbing elbows with the local deadbeat?
Wally: That hurt me soul.
Polly: Well, at least this guy doesn't waste my time with stuff I think is stupid and boring!
Anne: (gasps) Well, excuse me for trying to make you less of a disgusting little slob! (gasps)
Wally: (stunned)
Polly: (stunned)
Anne: Polly, I-- (stammers) That's not--I mean, what I mean is--(Screams suddenly as Tuti grabs her from behind.)
Tuti: Tuti caught thief!
Anne: Wait, what do you mean "thief"? I totally paid.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Sorry, little lady, but Hopadiah's broke. Which makes these IOUs you've been handing out totally worthless. (Steps aside to reveal Sprig and Hop Pop with handcuffs)
Anne: (gasps)
Sprig: These chains represent our burden on society!
Hop Pop: Dang it, Anne, how much did you spend?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Now pay up, or I'm gonna have to do my duty, and put y'all in debtor's prison.
Anne: We'll have to sit in a chicken coop?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Less like sittin' and more like gatherin' eggs for the town until your debt's paid off.
Anne: That doesn't sound so bad.
(screeching)
(screams)
Anne: No!
(all grunting)
Polly: You let my family go!
Anne: (gasps) That's it! Hey, mustache! Is that trophy made out of gold?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Twenty four karat, ma'am.
Anne: All right, Polly. Time to shine.
Polly: Wait, what?
Anne: Spit, dude. Spit like you've never spit before. Break that record, and save this family.
Polly: Let's do this.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Okay, little lady. You get three official chances. You ready?
(Polly spits twice, falling short.)
Villager: I don't think she's gonna make it.
Villager: It's not looking good.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Only one more chance, little lady.
Hop Pop: Something ain't right. She's not spitting at full force. Almost as if she's ashamed.
Anne: Yeah, and I think I know why. Hey, you okay?
Polly: Yeah. I guess it's just kinda hard to spit when you feel gross.
Anne: (sighs) Polly, I'm the gross one. I tried to change someone that's perfect the way they are.
Polly: You saying you were wrong?
Anne: Very wrong.
Polly: Super wrong?
Anne: Super wrong.
Polly: You're always wrong?
Anne: I'm always--Hey, not always.
Polly: Okay, just most of the time.
Anne: Mmm.
(They hug.)
Polly: Aw. Okay, let's finish this. (Spits and breaks record.)
(all cheering)
Anne: You did it!
(Tuti splits the trophy and distributes it to pay the townspeople before giving the Plantars a small nugget.)
Tuti: Here, extra.
Polly: Wow.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Well, your debt is repaid and my work here is done.
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! Go Polly!
Hop Pop: That's my little spitter.
Sprig: So what are we gonna do with the extra gold?
Anne: I think I have an idea.
Anne: A little to the left. There, that's perfect.
Sprig: (chuckles) Whoo-hoo!
Anne: Well?
Polly: I love it! Hey, sorry, girl time was such a bust.
Anne: Eh, don't worry about it. I mean, the more I think about it, the whole idea of girl time is pretty weird. I mean, who's to say boys don't like spas?
Sprig: (gasps) You went to the spa? Without us?
Hop Pop: Oh, Anne, I love the spa. Did you get that fishy pedicure?
Anne: Yeah, it was amazing.
Hop Pop: Oh, I agree. You know they're actually eating the dead skin off the bottom of your feet?
Felicia: My little girl's a woman.
Ivy: Mom!
Sprig: (gulps)
Hop Pop: All right, boy, go get that lucrative business relationship. I mean, romantic relationship. (chuckles) Saved it.
Sprig: (squeaking) Hey.
Ivy: Hi.
Sprig: Uh... these are for you.
Ivy: Oh. Thanks.
Sprig: So...you're looking like a... girl frog.
Ivy: Oh, okay. I like your, uh, collar.
Felicia: (sighs) I'm so happy we agreed on this merger, Hopadiah. That Sprig of yours looks like a hard worker.
Hop Pop: Like we agreed, you'll get Sprig to work at your restaurant, and I'll get the seeds to those Sundew vegetables.
Felicia: Agreed.
Anne: This is so exciting. I wonder what their ship name will be. Ivig? Sprigivy?
Polly: What are you even saying?
Hop Pop: Shh! Let's watch our little love doves fly. Love doves are birds that mate for life.
Anne: I got it.
Albus Duckweed: Excuse me, everybody, but I hear we have a couple of love doves here tonight. Ivy Sundew and Sprig Plantar. Whoo! A big hand for them. Come on, let me hear it. Hopadiah Plantar says, "Sprig, don't mess this up for us." And Felicia Sundew would like Ivy to "have a great courtship. Wink." It says "wink" here. "Love, Mom." All right, then. Hit it, boys!
(music playing)
(both chuckle nervously)
(both grunting)
Sprig: There we go.
Ivy: I had no idea you felt this way about me, Sprig.
Sprig: Oh, sure. Didn't you know two-thirds of all mates start with souls? Ah! I mean, two-thirds of all souls start with...(sighs) I can't do this. I'm really sorry, Ivy. I-- I don't want to date you. Everyone just convinced me this was a good idea.
Ivy: Oh, thank goodness! I only went along because I didn't want to hurt you. Also 'cause my mom forced me.
Sprig: Ha! Parents, am I right? What do you say we ditch this thing and go watch some fireflies? They're in season.
Ivy: (laughs) After you, friend.
Sprig: Why, thank you, friend.
(both laughing)
Anne: Ooh-la-la. The little love doves are sneaking off into the woods. You know what that means.
Felicia: It means they're abandoning the ritual! If those two don't finish that dance...
Hop Pop: Then this courtship will be ruined! Along with my financial security!
Anne: Wait, what? We cannot let them waste this chance. They say nine out of ten people stay up at night regretting missed romantic opportunities. Nine out of ten!
Hop Pop: Come on, gang. Let's get this merger back on track.
Polly: Uh, counterpoint. Why don't we just leave them alone?
Felicia: Ridiculous.
Hop Pop: Not a chance.
Anne: I'm way too invested right now.
(grunting)
Sprig: Wow. Man, this is way better than that stuffy old dance. Right, Ivy? Ivy? Ivy?
Ivy: Ambush!
Sprig: Ha ha!
Ivy: Oh, no, you don't.
Sprig: Ha ha ha!
Ivy: Come back here! This'll be your grave!
Sprig: That's, uh...That's pretty dark.
Hop Pop: Hmm. Where are those dang kids?
(wings flapping)
(bird screeches)
Hop Pop: What's that?
Anne: Huh?
Felicia: They're beautiful.
Polly: Just look at them.
Hop Pop: Love doves. Don't move or we're dead.
Anne: What? I thought they were all romantic and mate for life.
Hop Pop: Yeah, and they spend that life massacring all living things.
(both coo, shriek)
(all scream)
(squawking)
(all scream)
Hop Pop: Beautiful. (scream)
Sprig: Hey, purple ones.
Ivy: Oh, yeah, those are babies. I read that they're purple so the moms can find them if they get lost.
Sprig: What? That's adorable.
Ivy: I know, right?
Sprig: Bleh. (screaming) What the...
Ivy: That sounded like...
(screaming)
Sprig: Our families! We gotta help them!
Ivy: Way ahead of you. Come on, let's go!
(screeching)
(all grunt)
(all gasp)
(both shriek)
Anne: We're stuck.
(both squawk)
Anne: Uh, so they're not gonna eat us?
Hop Pop: Not right away. Love doves prefer to let their prey marinate in fear first.
Felicia: (groans) Can it, Plantar. This is all your fault. If you taught your grandson proper courtship technique--
Hop Pop: My fault? It's obviously yours.
Anne: (grunts, spits) Guys, it says here that our relationships define us, and nothing else. Nothing else!
(all speaking, indistinct)
Polly: (growls) Enough! It's all your faults.
Hop Pop: Say what?
Anne: Impossible.
Polly: Zip it! The only reason we're here marinating is because you all had to play matchmaker. You two were greedy, plain and simple.
Hop Pop: Maybe a little.
Felicia: It's nuanced.
Anne: Nice. Totally innocent for once. You two should be ashamed.
Polly: Are you kidding? Sprig only went through with this because of you and this dumb magazine!
(Growling like crazy, Polly tears the magazine apart in her mouth. When she's finished, she's left heavily panting.)
Anne: Wow. I feel lighter somehow, more... free.
Sprig: Hey! We're here to rescue you.
All: Whew!
Felicia: Oh, thank frog.
Ivy: We're also here to tell you we don't want to date each other and we never will.
Hop Pop: We know. Polly set us straight.
Felicia: Look, kids, we--
Anne: Sprig, I'm so sorry.
(shrieking)
Polly: I always tell them, "Save the heartfelt apologies for when we get to safety."
Ivy: Don't worry, guys. Sprig and I are ready for combat. Right?
Sprig: Right.
Ivy: On the count of three. One, two...
Ivy: Sprig?
Sprig: Ambush! Ha ha!
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Sprig: Take that, you beautiful creature!
(squawks)
(squawks)
Sprig: Whoa!
(cooing)
Ivy: Nice ambush.
Sprig: Well, I learned from the best. Now let's finish this up.
(squawks)
(sighs)
Hop Pop: Amazing. Even in defeat, they're majestic.
(cooing)
Felicia: Come along now, Ivy. Let's get you home so I can apologize safely.
Ivy: Okay. That was fun. See ya, Sprig!
Sprig: See ya, Ivy!
Hop Pop: Sprig, next time we won't get the courtship kit out until you're good and ready. Now I can focus on finding love for Polly.
Polly: No!
Anne: Well, that's the end of that. Now you and Ivy can go back to being just friends.
Sprig: Yep.
Anne: Oh, you just fell in love with her, didn't you?
Sprig: Yeah, I just fell in love with her.
Anne: (screams) Whoa!
(screaming)
Anne and Sprig: (gasp)
Hop Pop: Come on, kids, throw some dirt on it! Get some water!
Anne: (Scratches her back and finds huge spider)
Anne: (screams) Get it off! (screams) No, no, no! Get it off! Get it off!
Anne: (Rolls down hill in her sleeping bag) Whoa! No, no, no! No, no, no! (screams)
(thud)
Anne: Ow! Careful! I'm pretty sure those ticks caused internal damage.
Sprig: So, awkward question, but are you sure you wouldn't be happier back home?
Hop Pop: Seriously, Anne, no need to torture yourself. Take Bessie and go home. And don't you worry about us, 'cause we'll be just fine without you.
(echoing) Without you.
Anne: No! Look, I know it seems like I'm miserable, okay? But I'm not. It's just...It's just, uh...
(laughing)
Anne: I'm not used to such easy camping.
Sprig: Easy?
Hop Pop: Huh?
Anne: Look around you. Singing, butterflies, laughter. I guess I'm just used to something a little more... Extreme.
(Soggy Joe emerges from bush)
Anne: Ah!
Soggy Joe: So, this place ain't extreme enough for ya?
Anne: Uh, dang right it ain't.
Soggy Joe: (laughing hysterically) I can take you folks to a real campsite, one where there ain't none of this kiddie stuff, like shelter or potable water. Blech.
Hop Pop: Well, would a more extreme experience make you happy, Anne?
Anne: Uh, yeah?
Sprig: If Anne wants hard-core, we go hard-core. Lead the way, Mr., uh...
Soggy Joe: Name's Joe. Soggy Joe. (laughing)
Anne: Yeesh. Could you like, turn down the creep just a bit?
Soggy Joe: No!
(snail purrs)
Sprig: Aw.
(snarls)
(snail screams)
(groans)
Soggy Joe: We're here. We bunk here for the night. And in the morning, if we're still alive...
(all gasp)
Soggy Joe: I'll take you all out for pancakes.
Anne: Oh, that sounds great.
Hop Pop: I do like pancakes.
Soggy Joe: Want to hear a tale?
Anne: Uh...
Hop Pop: I'm good.
Polly: Hard pass, old man.
Sprig: Oh, me! I love scary stories.
(all groan)
Soggy Joe: Gather 'round and hear ye the tale of the Mud Men. Born in the bowels of the bog itself, the mud creatures stalk the inky night, lusting to devour any frogs that might have wandered into their domain. (Sinks beneath the mud)
Polly: Ten bucks says he doesn't come back up.
Soggy Joe: (Bursts up) Just like us! (laughs) Ah, yes. The Mud Men only fear two things. Daylight and being clean. Holy honey thistle!
Hop Pop: What? What is it, Joe?
Soggy Joe: Nature calls. Be right back.
Sprig: Is this extreme enough?
Anne: (screams) Uh... um...(laughs) What? No. I am loving this.
(Joe groans)
Sprig: Oh, uh, hey Sog Man. Everything okay?
(groans, falls over)
(all scream)
Hop Pop: Don't worry. Good thing I brought my copper matches.
(Mud man groans)
Sprig: It's the Mud Men!
(groaning)
Hop Pop: They're real!
Polly: And they're here for our delicious souls!
Anne: Oh, man, this is all my fault. Everyone, grab a torch!
(grunts)
Sprig: Back away!
Polly: (yells)
(all grunting)
(groaning)
(Mud Men moaning)
Sprig: Really wish we had some sunlight right about now.
Hop Pop: Or heck, cleaning products.
Anne: (gasps) I have something even better. Everyone, take cover! Peony Princess bath bomb! Good-bye, dear friend.
(grunts, spits)
(grunts)
(all groan)
Polly: Well, guess we're dead.
Hop Pop: Uh-huh.
(fizzing)
(both scream)
Mud man: The jig is up, boys!
Mud man: Quickly, before she throws another one of those things!
(all screaming)
Mud Man: Man, all I wanted to do today was get muddy and eat people.
(all cheer)
Polly: I can see your butt!
Hop Pop: Guess we were wrong to doubt you, Anne. You really are used to extreme camping.
Anne: (sighs) Guys, I have a confession. This extreme camping stuff is nonsense. I was miserable back there. I was just trying to cover it up.
Polly: So you dragged us to this horror show for no reason? Twisted. I love it.
Sprig: I don't understand. Why lie about it? Why be miserable?
Anne: I guess I've been feeling kind of left out lately. I'm not a frog.
Mud man: (grunts)
Anne: I'm not a Plantar. Heck, I wasn't even invited on this trip. I really like you guys and wanted to be with you, miserable or not.
Sprig: (tearful) I don't know if it's the sweet-smelling toxins or the overwhelming emotions, but dang it, I'm a mess.
Hop Pop: Next time, we'll include you, Anne, even if we know you'll hate it.
Anne: Thanks, you guys. Aah!
Soggy Joe: (groans)
(roars)
(all scream)
(groans, sighs)
Soggy Joe: Ooh-wee! (laughs) Good thing I wore my axe-proof vest, eh? So, what'd I miss?
Anne: Oh, pretty much everything.
Soggy Joe: Really?
Sprig: Oh, Joe, there were these crazy cannibals.
Soggy Joe: Wow.
Hop Pop: They tried to eat us.
Soggy Joe: Oh, serious?
Polly: Yeah, actually, it turned out they were just frogs.
Soggy Joe: Oh, no way.
Polly: Wimpy little frogs covered in mud.
Soggy Joe: Unbelievable.
Anne: And then we ran, we tried to use torches, it was all a big thing. It was very dramatic.
Soggy Joe: Yeah? Oh? Keep going.
Sprig: Anne saved us with her bath bomb.
Soggy Joe: Yeah, I smell it. It's great. Is that peony?
Anne: Yeah, that is peony.
Soggy Joe: Yeah, I have a nose for these things.
Anne: So, that's pretty much it. You're all caught up.
Soggy Joe: Oh, great.
(crickets chirping)
Soggy Joe: So, you all want to get pancakes early?
Anne: Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
Hop Pop: Let's get outta here.
Polly: I've always been more of a waffle girl, myself.
Anne: Guys, now that we've been through a lot, there's something I'd like to share with you. This is how I got here.
Polly: Wow.
Sprig: Shiny.
Hop Pop: Oh!
Anne: It's some kind of crazy music box or something. Have you guys seen anything like it before?
Hop Pop: May I?
Anne: Sure. I mean, it's busted.
Hop Pop: Hmm. (sniffs) Hmm. Hmm! Nope. Never seen anything like it.
Anne: Well, it was worth a shot.
Sprig: Anne, I promise... We're gonna find a way to get you home.
Anne: Thanks, Sprig. That means a lot to me.
Hop Pop: (yawns) Well, that's enough excitement for me today. I think I'm gonna turn in.
Polly: Good night.
Anne: Good night, Hop Pop.
(In his study, Hop Pop looks up the music box in an old book.)
Hop Pop: (gasps) It's just as I feared.
Anne: You know, Hop Pop, back home we call this a family tree.
Hop Pop: That's 'cause everyone in your world is crazy. Now, where was I? Oh, yes, Great Aunt Gertrude. She was a masterful dirt tiller. I mean, how cool is that?
All: Eh.
Hop Pop: Oh, and you can't forget second cousin Alfred. He was the king!
All: (gasp) A king?
Hop Pop: Yeah! The king of single-tiered irrigation systems.
All: (groaning)
Anne: Yep, you lost me.
Polly: Our ancestors were boring!
Sprig: Were they really all just farm frogs? Where are the artists? The poets? The dreamers?
Hop Pop: Just farm frogs? Kids, the point of the shrub is to give you an appreciation for your past. The Plantar family has layers. You just have to know where to look.
Anne: Layers, huh? Okay, then. Well, what's so special about her?
Hop Pop: Polli Anna? Oh, brace yourselves. She wasn't just any farmer. She was a turnip farmer!
All: (groans)
Anne: Welp, as much as I'd love to help, not gonna find any of my ancestors on your shrub, so...
(game music playing)
Hop Pop: Don't have to be blood to be a Plantar, Anne.
Anne: No, but you do have to be a master stacker to get to level 46. If I can just...(groans) Curse you, sudden death round! Why you so hard?
Hop Pop: Anne, this is based on nothing at all, but I'm almost certain that game will rot your brain! Uh-oh, looks like we're out of glue!
Sprig: Does that mean we have to stop?
Polly: Can we do something fun now?
Hop Pop: No fun till the shrub's done. Just gonna run to the store real quick and get more glue. Be back in a jiffy. (hums) Don't go anywhere!
Polly: Ah! You're lucky you're an outsider, Anne. Our family history is weak!
Sprig: They didn't do anything weird. Or different. Or fun. I mean, look at this. Even this painting's making me feel depressed. What the... Whoa!
Polly: Sprig! You broke the house.
Anne: Whoa. Oh, wow. This looks unsafe. We have to go down there.
Sprig: There could be treasure.
Polly: Or dead bodies! Let's do it!
Sprig: Uh, did we just get locked in here?
Anne: No, no, no.
Sprig: Let us out!
Anne: Help! Wait!
Polly: Come on, let's just find another way out, you babies.
All: Whoa. All this was under your house? (coughs) Oh, there's dust everywhere.
Sprig: This place is amazing. Whoa! Oh, what this? (exclaims) (laughs) Wow!
Polly: Hey, why do you think the entrance was hidden like that?
Sprig: To keep it a secret, obviously. Who wouldn't want to steal this stuff?
Anne: (shudders) Uh, me, me. I don't wanna steal this stuff.
Sprig: It says here this place belonged to Great Uncle Skip Plantar. He was a farmer and a brilliant scientist! He experimented with all kinds of stuff. This is wild. I wanna know more! Like, what does this do? (Pulls lever)
(gate opening)
Pumpkin Monster: (growling)
Pumpkin Monster: (breathing heavily)
Anne: Whoa...
Polly: Whoa, mama.
Sprig: Maybe it's harmless.
Pumpkin Monster: (furious roaring)
(all screaming)
Hop Pop: My, my, so many glues to choose from. (humming) This is gonna be a little difficult.
Loggle: Hey, Hopadiah! (exclaims) What brings you here?
Hop Pop: (exclaims) Oh, hey, Loggle. Just trying to find some glue to put my family shrub together.
Loggle: Oh, Hop Pop. All you need for that is this. (Puts hand over heart)
Hop Pop(tearful): Dang it, you're right. In the end, it's all about love.
Loggle: What? No, I meant you need this. (Pulls glue out of chest pocket.) Nothing stronger. This stuff will fix your shrub. Heck, it'll fix your house!
Hop Pop: Hmm. Intriguing. Yet another choice. Looks like my day just got a lot more challenging.
Pumpkin Monster: (screeching)
Pumpkin Monster: (low growl)
Anne: What do we do?
Polly: This abomination must be destroyed.
Sprig: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute. There may be another way.
Anne: Dude, what are you doing?
Polly: Yeah, that pumpkin will squash you.
Sprig: There, there. Easy does it.
Pumpkin Monster: (growls)
(Sprig shushes)
Sprig: There, there, you beautiful, disgusting thing.
Pumpkin Monster: (sighs)
Anne: What is happening?
Sprig: That's right, Mama Sprig is here.
Pumpkin Monster: chuckles
Sprig: Oh, you horrible, horrible, sweet boy. Forgive me.
(Slams gate shut, trapping the pumpkin. The pumpkin then claws at the gate and whimpers.)
Polly: Dude... that was ice cold.
Sprig: Love is the cruelest weapon.
Anne: Agreed. Now let's get out of here before something else happens.
(Floor collapses.)
Anne: (groans) You guys okay?
Polly: More or less.
Sprig: Yeah... ow.
Polly: Oh, cool, our lantern.
All: Whoa.
Polly: This is heaven. (gasps) This is the same Polliana from Hop Pop's shrub. She wasn't just a turnip farmer. She was a turnt up warrior!
Sprig: Hey, check it out. I found her diary.
Anne: The Bogwater Wars of '48. The Western Toad invasion of '53. Man, she was in a lot of battles.
Polly: She was the coolest, most terrifying Plantar ever. Like me!
Sprig: Wow, we sure are learning a lot. I'd like to learn more. Like, hey, what does this do? (Pulls a lever.)
(rumbling)
Sprig: Ah!
All: (gasp)
Anne: Will you please stop pulling levers?
Sprig: Levers are for pulling, Anne! Why is there a death trap here, anyways?
Anne: Says here this is Polliana's training simulator.
Sprig: Look out! Okay, how do we turn it off?
Anne: The shut off switch is by the exit on the other side.
Sprig: Okay, we can do this. We just gotta go very slowly--
Polly: (Bursts past while shouting)
Anne and Sprig: Polly!
Polly: Hiyah! (Disables machine)
(machine whirring down)
Anne: Well, that was intense.
Polly: So, you guys wanna do it again?
Anne and Sprig: Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Hop Pop: You know what? I'll just buy all of them. You can never have too much glue, I always say.
Loggle: Good choice!
Hop Pop: (screams) Glue! Everywhere! Need water!
Loggle: Hop Pop, no! That's more glue.
Hop Pop: (gasps) Loggle! Help me!
Loggle: No. No!
Anne and Sprig: Whoa.
Polly: Oh, wow. Can you believe it? Another mysterious hidden chamber.
Anne: Oh, cool! This place is filled with games and puzzles. Let's see if we can find which Plantar this stuff belonged to. No way. Emma the Newt? Honorary Plantar? Hey, check this out. She travelled all over the place, collected all this cool stuff, and settled with the Plantars. She wasn't even a frog!
Sprig: Wow, so cool.
Anne: I guess even an outsider like me can be a Plantar.
Sprig: Oh, Anne. Looks like you've solved the puzzle...of your own heart.
Anne: Wow, thanks buddy.
Sprig: No, thank you, buddy.
Polly: Hey! How about we solve the puzzle of getting the heck out of here!
Anne: Oh, we think the exit is that way.
Polly: Oh.
Sprig: (grunting) Well, it's locked.
Anne: Hmm.
Polly: Maybe I can smash it. Hiyah! Well, that didn't work.
Sprig: We're gonna die down here!
Anne: Wait a second. (gasps) Guys, this isn't just a door. It's a puzzle! All right, let's do this. (gasps) There, I did it!
(rumbling)
(all scream)
Polly: Anne, what did you do?
Anne: Oh, no! I know what this is. It's the sudden death round. (breathes deeply) You can do this, Anne. (grunting)
Sprig: Anne, no pressure, but we're gonna die.
Anne: Almost... there. Woo hoo! I did it! Take that, Hop Pop. Who's brain is rotten now, sucker?
(all sigh)
Anne: We had your family history all wrong, guys. The Plantars weren't just farmers.
Sprig: Nope, they were twisted.
Polly: Yeah, they were pretty cool. Now, can we finally find a way out of here?
Sprig(reaching for a lever): Yeah, and I think I know how.
Anne and Polly: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
(footsteps running)
(all breathing heavily)
Anne: Hop Pop! We found those Plantar family layers you were talking about.
Hop Pop: Eh? Found them? Kids, I wasn't being literal.
Sprig: Oh, Hop Pop!
Anne: There was a moving fireplace.
Polly: Secret rooms!
Sprig: Crazy science lab.
Polly: Family heirlooms!
Anne: Turnip with a face.
Sprig: Family's amazing!
Polly: Actually proud to be a Plantar.
Anne: Games don't rot your brain!
Hop Pop: Secret rooms? Full of Plantar family heirlooms? Why, this is incredible! And most importantly, once again, I was right.
Polly: Our ancestors were the most amazing scientist, warrior, farmers ever!
Sprig: Everyone needs to know.
Hop Pop: Well I want to see these rooms, too!
Anne: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there, Hop Pop. They're full or traps and super hard but satisfying puzzles.
Sprig: Oh, and there was a pumpkin abomination! A real affront to nature. I loved it! And then betrayed it.
Polly: No offense, but I'm not sure you could handle it.
Hop Pop: (laughs) You have no idea what I can or can't handle. What do you say, Loggle? Up for another adventure?
(Turns around to reveal Loggle glued to his back)
Loggle: Absolutely...not!
Anne: Hop Pop, no!
Sprig: (sighs) Should we go help them?
(ominous noises)
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Help!
Polly: Yeah, probably.
Sprig: Oh, oh, oh! Let's adopt that pumpkin monster.
Anne: There you go. Now you're getting it.
Hop Pop: Anne, wanna chop us some veggies for me?
Anne: You got it, HP.
(Anne grunts as she bounces a vegetable onto the table, cuts it with ease and places it in a bowl.)
Hop Pop: Wow, where'd you learn to cut like that?
Anne: You know, my parents actually owned a Thai restaurant back home. (She pulls out her phone, which shows a picture of Domino.) Ah, whoops. Hold on. (Shuffles through her photos until one of Thai Go is shown.) I used to work there all the time and help out. I hope they're doing okay without me.
Hop Pop: Well, how about that. A restaurant.
Polly: Pretty impressive, Anne.
(An explosion goes off. Sprig is lying on the floor covered in soot.)
Sprig: Yep, I blew up the pizza.
Hop Pop: Oh, dang it, Sprig. Well, looks like this meal's a bust. Who wants to eat out?
Anne: Oh, wow. This place is not to code.
Anne: Oh, man. The font on these menus is way too small. Rookie mistake.
Stumpy: Here you are. Four bowls of slop. Enjoy. Or don't. Makes no difference to me.
Sprig: Thanks, Stumpy.
Albus Duckweed: Excuse me, hello. Over here. Yoo hoo!
Stumpy: There be a problem, sir?
Duckweed: Um, yes, there's only one fly in my soup. There should be dozens. I mean, how hard is it to run a restaurant, anyway? You just put food on tables. A tadpole can do it.
Anne: (groans) Who's that jerk? And why won't he shut up?
Sprig: That is Albus Duckweed. He writes reviews for the paper. They have comic strips sometimes.
Polly: Blah! He thinks he's better than everyone else just 'cause he talks good.
Hop Pop: It's true.
Anne: (groans) A foodie. Say no more. We dealt with snobs like him all the time back home. Just listening to him is driving me crazy. (groans) I can't take this anymore.
Hop Pop: Anne, just ignore it and enjoy your slug gruel. Anne?
Duckweed: I mean, seriously, look at this place.
Anne: Hey. Lay off, buddy. Running a restaurant is hard.
Stumpy: Kid, what are you doing?
Duckweed: Ha! Well, what does a creature like you know about running a restaurant?
Anne: Well, what does a little lizard like you know about anything? Besides, my parents ran a restaurant back home, so I know what I'm talking about.
Duckweed: Well, if your parents are anything like you, I'm sure their restaurant was terrible.
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, tell you what, then. Why don't you come back in, I don't know, two days or something? And we'll have completely turned this place around.
Stumpy: I, uh, I beg your pardon. What?
Duckweed: Oh, a wager, is it? Fine, I'll be back in two days. Looking forward to writing my review and shutting this place down.
Stumpy: Kid, what have you done? That was the most popular critic in town. One bad review from him and we're finished.
Anne: Stumpy, I know I got carried away, but we can do this. The Boonchuy family pride is at stake. What do you say?
Stumpy: I say... you just put me out of business. Bound to happen eventually, I suppose.
Hop Pop: Anne, did you just promise to save this restaurant?
Sprig: In two days?
Polly: By yourself?
Anne: Yep. That's, uh, that's pretty much what just happened. Uh, me and my big mouth.
(Stumpy humming)
Stumpy: Dang mushroom needs replacing. Not that it matters anymore. (finds Anne standing in the corner with a wide smile; exclaims) Mother of pearl!
Anne: Hey, Stumpy!
Stumpy: How long you been here?
Anne: All night. Couldn't sleep, too excited! So, you ready to beat that critic?
Stumpy: (scoffs) Creepy kid.
Anne: What do you wanna start with? Change the menu, redecorate... Burn this place to the ground and start over?
Stumpy: Look, kid, you're on your own. Do whatever you want. It's not gonna make a difference in the end, anyway.
Anne: (laughs) Oh. That is where you're wrong.
Anne(cleaning): Pow! Ha-cha! Ha!
(Hits Wally in the face with mop)
Wally: Oh, what day is it?
(grunting)
(Stumpy groans)
(growling)
(screams)
(growls)
Stumpy: (laughs) I knew about that garbage lizard.
(sighs)
(shouting)
Stumpy: (Stumpy laughs) Nice shot. Direct hit! You got it. Whoo!
Anne: Thanks.
Stumpy: One at a time.
Stumpy: I gotta hand it to you, Anne. This place looks great. We even scrubbed the Wally out.
Wally: That's what you think! (laughs)
(crashing)
Stumpy: The critic is gonna be blown away.
Anne: Blown away? Ha! No. All we've done is mop the floors and clean some dishes. This place is still a house of broken dreams.
Stumpy: Harsh, but on point.
Anne: If we're gonna impress that critic, we've got a lot more work to do. We need a complete and total transformation.
Stumpy: What do you mean? Like placemats?
Anne: Bigger.
Stumpy: Oh. I'm gonna need me hammer hand for this.
(whirring, hammering)
(The next day)
Mrs. Croaker: What are you all looking at?
(crowd chattering)
Villager: Stumpy's changed overnight.
Villager: Wow, look over there.
Villager: It's so exotic.
Villager: Oh, my goodness.
Anne: swasdiikha (swadi-ka; translates to "good evening" or "hello" in Thai) (as she does a wai) And welcome to Stumpy's! Wartwood's first frog-Thai fusion restaurant, now with napkins.
(crowd chattering)
Villager: Napkins? What are those?
(The scene fades to an aerial view of inside the restaurant, with people eating inside)
Anne: Need a refill of fly ice tea? On the house, sweetie.
Anne: Order up. Enjoy!
Villager: Mmm.
Villager: That's good.
Mrs. Croaker: I'll take the maggot larb. Did I say that right? Larb?
Anne: It's actually pronounced "laap."
Mrs. Croaker: Well, how about that? One foot in the grave and still learning new things.
Stumpy: I've never seen this place so packed. What-- What's this weird feeling in me chest?
Anne: That is called hope. I think we might actually pull this off, dude.
Anne: Please. Please stop ringing that bell.
Sprig: Anne, this place is amazing.
Hop Pop: You weren't kidding when you said you were good at this.
Anne: Oh, yeah! Score one for Anne.
Hop Pop: So, table for three.
Anne: Ooh, sorry guys. All the tables are full.
(Frog clears his throat loudly, unzips costume to reveal Albus Duckweed.)
Duckweed: They can have my table. I am done here.
Anne: (gasps) It's...
Stumpy: Duckweed! He's here!
Mrs. Croaker: I have another question.
Stumpy: Thanks for coming.
Anne: Okay, great, see ya.
Anne: Duckweed...What's with the disguise?
Duckweed: Oh, this? It's kind of a critic thing.
Anne: Really?
Duckweed: Uh-huh. It's to guarantee that we get a genuine experience, you know?
Anne: Oh, interesting.
Duckweed: If you knew it was me, you'd probably zhuzh it up a bit, make it a little bit better. But in a disguise, you're just gonna serve me like anyone else.
Anne: Oh, that's actually really clever.
Duckweed: Thank you!
Anne: So, did you like the food?
Duckweed: Oh, right... No! I found the experience had no cohesion, like one thing was clumsily grafted on top of another. And when I publish my review, your restaurant will be ruined. (laughs) I love my job.
Anne: Will you, uh... Will you give us a moment? Stay right there!
Stumpy: That's it. It's over. We're finished! The second that review goes up, this restaurant goes down.
Anne: (grunts) Pull yourself together, man. We can do this. It's time to bring out the big guns. My parents' squid and basil special. No critic in town could resist.
Stumpy: Okay. (Anne smacks him.) I already said okay!
Anne: Sorry, sorry. I am amped!
Anne: Hey, we've got a special dinner just for you. Be right back.
Stumpy: Don't go anywhere.
Duckweed: Amusing. All right, I'll play your little game.
Hop Pop: So...this mean we can't have your table?
Anne: Man, squid are huge here.
Stumpy: It's not a squid. It's a kraken.
Anne: Eh, potato, tomato. (grunts) Gangway, coming through. All right, dude. Get ready to be blown away.
Duckweed: Oh, my...What an exotic selection.
Kraken: (growls)
(Duckweed screams)
Kraken: (roaring)
Polly: Assassinating your critics, I love it.
Kraken: (roaring)
Anne: Okay, this is a disaster. I never should have made this dumb wager.
Stumpy: Anne, calm down. Maybe we can't save the restaurant, but we sure can save those people's lives. What do you say?
Anne: I say...let's crush this calamari. (gasps) I've got an idea.
(exclaims)
Kraken: (roars)
(all screaming)
(yells)
Stumpy: Mm... Oh, that's good.
Anne: Stumpy! The lemon!
Stumpy: Coming right up!
Anne: Pad See Ew, you later.
Kraken: (screeches)
Sprig: Yeah, I don't think this thing's getting back up.
All: Phew.
Anne: So, Duckweed. Guess you got a bad review to write, huh?
Duckweed: Bad...Bad? That was incredible! A food that tries to eat you? The irony, the ecstasy! I simply must tell everyone. To the message board!
Sprig: You go, girl!
Polly: Go, Anne!
Hop Pop: She lives in my basement.
Anne: Wait, you guys have a message board?
Sprig: Sure do. It's a literal board.
Anne: Well, guess we better clean this place up. Again. Stumpy, I'm sorry about all this. I took things way too far.
Stumpy: No way, Anne. This whole thing was a big success. You even convinced this old grump to actually care. If your parents could see this, I'm sure they'd be proud.
Anne: Thanks, Stumpy. Put her there. Oh, this feels nice. What is this? Oak? Mahogany?
Stumpy: It's carved from the bones of me missing hand.
Anne: Oh, come on!
(The next day)
(groans, belches)
Hop Pop: Friends and frog folk, step right up. New limited edition Plantar's Potion. Only 20 coppers a bottle!
Anne: Twenty coppers? No one's gonna buy that--
Crowd: (roars)
Hop Pop: Thank you for your patronage.
Villager: I'm gonna feed this to my baby.
Anne: (groans) Well, did we make it? Did we save the stand?
Hop Pop: Just about. We gotta sell to one more sucker and we'll be home free.
Mrs. Croaker: I'll take a bottle, Hopadiah.
Hop Pop: (gasps) Sadie Croaker, the stand's oldest and most loyal customer.
Mrs. Croaker: Usually, I find potions and the like to be a bunch of malarkey, but if Hopadiah Plantar says it works, then it must.
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm.
Mrs. Croaker: Been saving this gold farthing for a while now. Waiting for something special to spend it on. One bottle, please.
Hop Pop: Uh... we're all sold out.
Polly: No, we're not!
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, thank you, deary.
Hop Pop: (stammers)
Mr. Croaker: To Hop Pop and the Plantars, the most honest folks in the business.
Anne: (winces and holds her chest) Oof, even I felt that one.
All: To the Plantars!
Hop Pop: No! (Slaps the potion out of Mrs. Croaker's hand.)
Mrs. Croaker: What has gotten into you, Hopediah?
Hop Pop: That was no health potion! It's garbage! (His voice echoes.) Folks, I'm so sorry. I never meant any harm. All I was trying to do was save my stand.
Hop Pop: Huh?
Sprig and Polly: (scream)
Polly: Hop Pop!
Sprig: They want the garbage potion!
(crowd screaming)
Wally: Eaten by flies? Oh, the irony!
Anne: Hey, let go of my bumpkin frog family!
(screams)
Hop Pop: Hey! Ain't this what you want?
(all scream)
Hop Pop: You really want this so bad? Then drop the kids and go get it!
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Oh! (sighs) Everyone okay?
Sprig: Not really.
Hop Pop: Kids, I messed up big. I was so desperate to save the stand, I forgot what the stand was even about.
Anne: So, what now?
Hop Pop: We go make things right. That's the Plantar way.
Hop Pop: Apologies.
Frog: (scoffs)
Hop Pop: Here you go, sir. I hope you'll give Plantar's another chance, someday.
Anne: I know things are bad, Hop Pop, but if it makes you feel any better, you were a crazy good salesman.
Hop Pop: (laughs) I was good, wasn't I?
Mrs. Croaker: Well, Hopadiah, looks like you're going to have to earn our trust back. That being said, I think your father would be proud that you did the right thing today.
Hop Pop: Thanks, Sadie. I'll work hard to earn your trust back.
Toadie: Not at this stand, you won't! No coin, no stand. Time to clear out!
Sprig: Don't worry, Hop Pop. We'll help you get the stand back.
Polly: You want me to...(clicks tongue) off Toadie? I'll do it. You know I will.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. Let's just get home and relax a little. You know, maybe the end of one tradition means the start of another. Maybe I ought to start over the Hop Pop way, experiment with those new seed varieties I always wanted to try.
Anne: That's the spirit, Hop Pop.
Sprig: Yeah, we're gonna make it after all.
(all laugh)
Polly: The future is ours.
Hop Pop: Oh, frog! I'm unemployed!
Hop Pop: Oh! Pill bugs are on sale.
Anne: Ooh! That reminds me. I'm gonna go grab some of that beetle jerky I like. Can't believe I just said that.
Hop Pop: Okay, kiddo. See ya outside.
(grunts)
Anne: Hmm. Where is that--Aha! Score. And I got the last one.
(Wally grabs it first.)
Anne: Hey! That was totally mine, Wally.
Wally: Ya snooze, ya lose, scarecrow. (guffaws)
Anne: Hey! Don't call me scarecrow. Oof!
Mrs. Croaker: Hey! Move your big behind, scarecrow. Croaker needs her cookies.
Anne: My behind's not big. I'm big. Technically, it's to scale. Whoa!
Teen worker: Hey! Didn't you see the sign, scarecrow?
Felicia: Classic, clumsy scarecrow.
Villagers: (all laughing)
(Anne flushes red in embarrassment and exits the store.)
Sprig: So did you get the beetle jerky you--Hey, what's wrong?
Anne: (sighs) Well, it's just...I've been here over a month now, and the townspeople still treat me crummy. I just wish they were a little nicer.
Hop Pop: Oh, that's just the way these frogs are. Slow to accept, and even slower to respect. It's actually our town motto. You'll find a way to get their respect, in your own weird Anne way. Now, who wants pill bug pancakes?
Anne: Ooh! My favorite. (stunned) I've been here too long.
Hop Pop: Well, that statue's new.
Sprig: And tasteless. Woof!
(all gasp)
(Bessie chirps)
Anne: Whoa, whoa, girl. Easy. What's wrong?
(bones crack)
Bog: Ah! Nothing like cracking your neck after a long drive. Ain't that right?
(door opens)
Toadstool: Oh, good. You're here. Toadie, give 'em the list.
Anne: Who are those guys?
Hop Pop: Toads from Toad Tower. They rule over the entire valley.
Anne: Toad what?
Sprig: It's a big, scary tower deep in the swamp and the toads that live there are the valley's fiercest warriors.
Anne: Whoa! Cool.
Hop Pop: Cool, yes. But they can be a rough sort. It's probably for the best that we all stay clear of--Oh, dang it. There they go.
Sprig: Hey, guys. So, you're from Toad Tower?
Bog: Sure are, runt.
Sprig: (laughs) My name's Sprig, actually.
Bog: Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. Whoa! What is that? It's some kind of gangly new critter I've never seen before.
Fens: I wonder what it tastes like.
Sprig: Whoa, whoa, hey. She is not for eating.
Anne: Don't come any closer.
Fens: Is that a challenge? (laughs, growls)
(grunting)
(laughs)
Fens: Whoa, that was awesome.
Bog: Well met, creature. I don't know what you are, but you've got fire.
Sprig: (grumbles)
Hop Pop: Okay, kids. That's enough flirting with death. Let's head home.
Sprig: Blech, finally. Come on, Anne.
Anne: I was thinking we could hang out with these guys a little longer. They seem pretty cool.
Sprig: (scoffs) Cool? More like smelly. Not to mention creepy.
Mire: (raspy breathing)
Anne: Wait a second. Are you jealous I think they're cool?
Sprig: No. Ha! If you wanna hang out with some grody toads, Anne, be my guest. No skin off my skin.
Hop Pop: Okay. But don't dally too long, Anne.
Polly: I'm eating your pancakes!
Sprig: Not jealous!
Anne: Oh, he jelly.
Anne: Hey. I didn't get a chance to ask your--
Bog: Name's Bog. The silent one there is Mire. And Fens here you already met.
Anne: I'm Anne. What are you guys doing in Wartwood?
Bog: Every year, this town sends taxes to the tower. Well, this year, they came up short. So, the Mayor gave us this list of frogs who didn't pay and we're just here to collect. Say, we could use someone like you.
Anne: Really?
Bog: Yeah. You've got inside knowledge of this town. It'll make the whole job go a lot smoother.
Anne: Oh. Um...I don't know. I'm not sure any of this is my business.
Bog: You know, the best part of wearing this badge is how everyone in this town will have to treat you with respect.
Anne: Gimme that ding-dang thing!
Hop Pop: Got yer last frog. Whoo! You lose. Oh, yeah!
(door opens)
Anne: Guess who became a Toad Tower deputy!
All: What?
Anne: Also, check out this cool sword Bog gave me.
(Swings sword and slices coat hanger.)
Anne: I can fix that.
Hop Pop: Anne, when I said earn the town's respect, I didn't mean join a gang.
Anne: (scoffs) I don't believe this. They're not a gang. They're just here to do a job. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some respect to enjoy.
Hop Pop: Uh, boy, what are you doin'?
Sprig: I have a bad feeling about this. So I'm gonna go follow Anne and watch over her.
Hop Pop: That's all well and good, but can you at least use the front door?
Sprig: No.
Bog: All right. First name on the list.
Anne: So, how does this work? Do we remind Wally how much he owes or--
(Bog grunts)
Wally: (singing, screams) Jumping June bugs! What's all this about?
(chuckling)
Anne: I, uh, guess you owe the town money?
Wally: Rubbish. I may live in squalor, but I always pay my taxes.
Bog: The mayor's list says otherwise. And since you haven't paid, we'll be taking your stuff.
Wally: (whimpering)
Bog: Here you go, Anne. Little something extra for you.
(He hands her a bag of beetle jerky.)
Anne: Oof! Bog, this seems a little extreme.
Bog: It's just the way we do things here. Plus, it's not like we enjoy it. Now who wants to race to the next house? (laughs)
Anne: (whispers) Here, take this back.
Bog: Come on, Anne!
Anne: Comin'.
Wally: Thanks.
Sprig (from a distance): That's weird. Wally always pays his taxes.
Toadstool: Come on.
Sprig: (gasps)
Toadstool: Come on, Toadie. While the townsfolk are preoccupied.
Toadie: (panting) Coming, sir.
(jingling)
Sprig: A copper coin? The mayor? A hole? In the bag? Hmm.
(jingling continues)
(Toadie grunts)
Sprig: I hope you'll be okay, Anne.
Fens: (chuckles)
Felicia: Oh, how horrid.
Anne: (whispers) Here, take this.
Felicia: (gasps)
Bog: (laughing)
Loggle: No, no, no, not the statue. No!
Anne: Psst.
Loggle: Oh! (sobbing) Yes. Oh!
Mrs. Croaker: Archie! Sic 'em.
Archie: (snarls)
Mire: (gurgling)
Mire: (roars)
Archie: (whimpers)
Anne: Here you go.
Archie: (squeaks, pants)
Anne: I don't know, guys. This whole thing feels (grunts) wrong.
Bog: The law's the law, Anne. It can be tough, but this kind of work needs to get done.
Fens: Yeah. Needs to get done. Stuff, gotta get it done.
Anne: I...guess that makes sense. Who's next on the list?
Bog: Eh, some nut named Hopadiah Plantar.
Anne: Oh, crud. Bog, that list has to be wrong. I know that frog. He's totally honest.
Bog: Anne, the tower didn't get any taxes, okay? And if we didn't get the money, then where is it?
(Toadstool hides the missing taxes inside the new statue.)
Toadstool: It's flawless, Toadie. The perfect plan. Who would think to look for the missing taxes in plain sight?
Toadie: Master stroke, sir.
Toadstool: Quickly now. Let's skedaddle before anyone notices--
Sprig: The taxes! You fiends! Everyone's gonna be furious when they find out about this.
Toadstool: Well, then it's a good thing you'll never get to tell them.
(shouts)
Sprig: Well, ya gotta catch me first. (raspberry)
Toadstool: Hey! Get after him.
(grunting)
(thunder rumbling)
Hop Pop: Like I said, I already paid my dang taxes. You can't come in here, and that's final.
Bog: I don't like your tone, frog. Or did you forget who you're talking to?
Anne: Bog, I am telling you, he paid his taxes. He... He made me watch.
Hop Pop (flashback): So then you add up your deductibles and... Oop! Guess what, Anne? You're a deductible!
Anne (flashback): Kill me.
Anne: (shudders)
Bog: Anne, they all say they've paid. I don't care what you think you saw. The list don't lie. Now, what should we start with?
Fens: Well, how about that thing?
Bessie: (purrs, chirps)
Hop Pop: You stay away from her.
Polly: I'll bite your face off!
Bog: Good choice. That snail should cover everything. Mire, Fens, Anne, move out.
(chirping, purring continues)
Hop Pop: You monsters!
Anne: (straining)
Bessie: (chirps)
Anne: Stop!
Anne: You keep your claws off that snail. Better yet...get off our property.
(thunderclap)
Bog: Care to repeat that?
Anne: I said get lost. Now!
All: (gasps)
Wally: Oh, she's brave.
Mrs. Croaker: What did she just say?
Anne: All I wanted was this town's respect. But just because these people treated me crummy doesn't mean I'm going to do the same to them. I'm done with this. I don't care if they've broken the law. You can't treat people like this!
All: (gasp)
Bog: (fingers snap)
(Fens pushes Anne to the ground.)
Anne: (grunts)
Hop Pop: Anne!
(Mire grabs Hop Pop and Polly.)
Polly: Hey! Let me go.
Hop Pop: Let me go. Let me go!
Bog: Tsk, tsk, tsk. How disappointing. Do you know what we do to traitors in the tower, Anne?
Fens: (cackles) You're about to be a pill bug pancake, you little brat.
Anne: Your foot's about to be a pancake. (grunts)
(She rolls out of the way, Bog's hammer hits Fens' foot instead.)
Fens: (screams)
(growls)
(grunting)
(grunting)
Bog: (laughs)
Anne: No!
(Anne screams)
Bog: (laughs)
Bog: Sorry, creature. It's just business. (groans) What the--
Sprig: You leave her alone!
Wally: Yeah, you leave our Anne alone.
Felicia: She's one of us.
Mrs. Croaker: If you got a problem with her, you got a problem with all of us.
(straining)
(squealing)
Sprig: Anne!
Anne: Hey, what took you so long?
Sprig: Sorry, I got tied up.
Mayor Toadstool: (huffing) Oh, boy. Gotta cut back on them cricket nuggets. Whoo!
Sprig: Arrest that toad. He stole the town's money and was keeping it all for himself.
(all gasping)
Wally: Gosh!
(all murmuring)
Sprig: May I? (grunts) I think you should do the honors.
(Bog smashes the statue - coins spill out.)
All: (gasp)
Mrs. Croaker: No-good son of a slug!
Toadstool: People, I needed the extra money for my campaign. Do you have any idea how much it costs to buy your love?
(The citizens get out some produce.)
Toadstood: Uh... And as mayor, I hereby pardon myself of any wrongdoing. Thank you. Good day.
Villager: Get out of here, you scoundrel.
(yelling)
Bog (to Anne): If it was respect you were looking for, you sure lost mine. You've a lot of nerve, I'll give you that. (laughs) We'll be back, Anne, and we won't be alone. (grunts)
Hop Pop: She don't need your respect.
Wally: Yeah. She's got ours!
(all cheering)
Bog: Hyah!
Fens: So are we gonna tell the captain about that creature we found?
Bog: Oh, we're gonna tell the captain everything.
Wally: Three cheers for Anne, defender of Wartwood.
All: Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
Anne: Aw, thanks, guys. (sniffles) Now who wants to sign my cast?
Sprig: Me, me, me. I'm her best friend.
Polly: Me! Out of the way, you plebes.
Wally: Oi! I can't write. (laughs)
(A black screen shows the words "Far, far away from Wartwood" in red text.)
(whinnies)
(grunting)
(cheering)
Toad soldier: Work that tongue. Yeah, come on!
Soldiers: Whoo!
Toad soldier: Bull's-eye!
(Captain Grime enters the room.)
(cheering stops)
Toad soldier: It's Captain Grime!
Toad soldier: Captain Grime's here!?
Toad soldier: Captain Grime!?
(raspy breathing)
Grime: So, these are the valley's strongest warriors. Pathetic! Wait, hold on. Is this guy seriously wearing his breastplate as pants?
Soldier: Uh, it won't happen again, sir.
Grime: No, it won't. Take him to the pain room. (fingers snap)
Soldier: Not the pain room. I hate pain!
Grime: I'm sure you've all heard frogs in the valley are getting unruly. They're questioning our authority. Some towns have even stopped paying their taxes. And do you know why?
Soldier: Maybe they, I don't know, forgot?
Grime: No, you imbeciles! You've all gotten soft.
(gulps)
(croaks)
Grime: To get this valley under control, I need warriors who are fierce, cunning, and above all, ruthless!
(squeaking)
(A cockroach starts eating a drip of Sasha's gruel. She crushes it with a loose brick.)
Sasha: Get your own food, you dumb bug.
(door unlocks)
Sasha: Huh?
Percy: Hey, Sasha. Brought you dinner. Cricket Thursdays.
Sasha: Percy!
Percy: Hey, I've been working on my act. Do you wanna see it?
Sasha: Totally! Bring it.
Percy: Okay, stay right there.
(music playing)
Percy: Ta-da!
Sasha: Whoo! Wow! Get it, toad! That was legit, Percy. Honestly, you're wasting your time here as a guard.
Percy: You know what? You're right. Thanks, Sasha. I can't wait to see the look on Grime's face when I tell him that I'm--
(gasps)
(Captain Grime enters the room.)
Grime: Tell me what?
Percy: Uh...That I quit and I've always hated this job. Bye!
Grime: (sighs)
Sasha: Hey there, Grimesy! What's that, like, the fifth toad I've talked into leaving this week?
Grime: There's plenty more where that came from, and far more loyal than Percy.
Sasha: Are you sure about that? You're not exactly Mr. Popular around here.
Grime: Enough! Now who--
Sasha: Sent me? No one. How'd I get here? Don't know. What do I want? To find my friends and go home. Haven't we been through this enough?
Grime: It'll be enough once you start giving me real answers. Until then--
(Braddock runs in.)
Braddock: Captain Grime! Captain Grime! Sir! Oh, hey, Sash.
Sasha: Braddock! Hey, girlfriend. How's the garden coming along?
Braddock: (gasps) Oh, it's gorgeous. You should see the squash--
Grime: Did you need something, soldier?
Braddock: Oh! Right. Yes. We may have a small problem.
Braddock: There.
(screeches)
Grime: Kill the torches. Fast!
Braddock: Sir.
Sasha: A bird? You guys are scared of a bird?
Grime: Quiet. It's not just a bird. It's a heron, a murderous predator that happens to love the taste of flesh.
(screeches)
Sasha: Cute.
Grime: The most important thing right now is that we be very, very quiet.
(door creaking)
(music playing)
(Percy comes through the door loudly playing his several instruments.)
Sasha (whispering): Come back. Get back here.
Grime (whispering): Percy, come back.
Braddock (whispering): Percy!
Grime (whispering): Get back here, Percy.
Percy (loudly): Sorry, guys. But this toad's gotta follow his dreams!
(The herons start attacking Percy, he runs back toward the Tower and they follow him.)
(screeches)
(screams)
(pants, shouts)
(growls)
Grime: Don't lead them here, you fool. Ugh!
(horn blares)
Grime: Close the gates.
Percy: Wait for me!
Sasha: Whoa, this is serious.
(screeches)
Sasha: Oh, crud!
(all screaming)
Grime: Ah, this place is falling apart!
(sobbing)
(screeching)
(whimpers)
Soldier: Find a happy place. Find a happy place.
Grime: Come on, you cowards. Fight back.
(screams)
Grime: Do something!
Sasha: Bring it on, birdbrain!
Grime: Hmm?
(Sasha attacks one of the herons, which has smashed through the wall of her prison.)
Sasha: Eat this!
(screeches)
Grime: The creature can fight. She could be worth something.
(grunts)
(Grime frees Sasha from her chains. She immediatly gets up and runs.)
Grime: Creature, fight with me. And together we'll--And she's gone.
(grunting)
Grime: I'm not afraid of death.
(Sasha returns holding a large barrel, which she throws at the heron.)
Sasha: Hey! Ugly chicken! (grunts)
Heron: (whimpers)
Grime: (laughs) Where did you get moves like that?
Sasha: Cheerleading, believe it or not.
Grime: I'm sorry, cheer what?
Sasha: Okay, listen up. If I help you get rid of these birds, you will give me provisions and release me. Deal?
Grime: Deal. Now grab every toad you can and head to the safe room.
(heron screeching)
Grime: Quickly.
(loud thudding)
(all groan)
(whimpering)
Percy: You know what would lighten this atmosphere a little bit? A joke! How many herons does it take to storm a castle?
(Grime points his sword at him.)
Percy: Too soon?
Grime: You lot are, without a doubt, the most useless group of toads I have ever seen.
All: Aw!
Grime: Maybe if any of you had a scrap of courage, we wouldn't be in here cowering like a bunch of--
Sasha: (laughs) Okay.
Grime: What?
Sasha: All right. Let's take five. Grimesy, a word in private, please?
Sasha: Okay, if you keep yelling at them like that, they'll keep being useless, and we'll all die.
Grime: What do you suggest, I congratulate them? Give them each an award?
Sasha: Not exactly. Just try saying nice things for a change. Get them to love you, and they'll do anything for you.
Grime: That actually works?
Sasha: Oh, it works, all right. Trust me.
Grime: Mmm. I don't know.
Sasha: Here, I'll give you a head start. Whoa, Grime! So you think your guards are all amazing but you're afraid to tell them your true feelings?
Grime: What? What are you--
Sasha: What's that? You think Braddock is the toughest toad in the tower 'cause she doesn't take garbage from anyone?
Grime: Uh...Yes! Braddock is tough. Tough as beetle skin.
Soldier: Ooh, look at you!
Soldier: Oh, way to go.
Braddock: (chuckles) Oh, well, I do wash with a steel wool brush. It really hurts.
Sasha: And what were those nice things you said about Gary?
Grime: Oh, Gary. Gary, Gary. Um...Gary never missed a day, even when he was sick.
Gary: What can I say, I'm dedicated.
Soldier: Ooh! Can't believe he actually likes us.
Sasha: And Percy?
Grime: I don't wanna do Percy.
Sasha: And Percy?
Grime: Percy's a grubbing idiot.
All: (gasp)
Percy: (whimpers)
Soldier: Ooh.
Soldier: Harsh.
Grime: Uh...But, when he makes a mistake, he owns it. And he doesn't stop until he makes things right. And because of that...
(gasping)
Grime: He has...
Sasha: Come on, come on.
Grime: (grunts) He's earned my respect.
All: (gasp)
Percy: (gasps) I have?
Grime: (stammers) Yes?
Percy: (sniffles) Captain Grime, sir, we're taking this tower back, even if we have to fight through 20 herons. Now come on, you toads. No one wants to live forever!
(cheering)
(whooping)
(screeching)
Percy: (gulps) For Grime!
All: (cheer)
Percy: Before we die, Braddock, I love you. I've always loved you.
Braddock: (gasps) (She slaps Percy then pulls him into a kiss.)
(screeching)
Grime: Up here, pheasants!
(both whooping)
(both shouting)
(screeching)
(grunts)
(Sasha grunting)
(both shouting)
(screeching)
(Sasha and Grime defeat the herons and the herons fly off)
All: Whoa.
Grime: Toads of Toad Tower, today was a great victory. If it weren't for your bravery, the fortress would be lost. You're all heroes!
Soldier: Did Grime...
Braddock: Just call us...
Percy: Heroes?
(all cheering)
Grime: All right, troops, listen up.
All: Sir, yes, sir!
Grime: Okay. Wow. Um...Head down to the mess hall for some food and a round of beetle mead. You've earned it.
All: Sir, yes, sir!
Toad: Hup, hup, hup, hup!
Grime(to Sasha): Unbelievable. This compliment stuff is witchcraft.
Sasha: Uh-huh, yeah, okay. Anyways, I upheld my part of the deal. So give me some rations, a map, maybe a cool cloak or two, and I'll be on my way.
Grime: Not so fast. You're far too dangerous and manipulative to be left to roam free.
Sasha: You warty little--
Grime: But we both know I can't stop you. So go ahead, be a vagabond, wandering alone in the wilderness.
Sasha: Or?
Grime: Or stay here. Help us rebuild the tower. Perhaps serve as my second-in-command. And when we're done here, you, me, and the entire garrison will march on the valley, restore order, and find your friends. Now, how does that sound?
Sasha (thinking): I think I can live with that.
Grime: Then come, Lieutenant. We have much to discuss.
(Grime exits while Sasha stays)
Toad (offscreen): Captain Grime, sir. Bog has just returned from Wartwood and is waiting for you in the briefing room.
(Sasha pulls out her BFF photo of her, Anne and Marcy.)
Sasha (to herself): Hold on for a little longer, girls. I'm coming for you. And when I find you, we're gonna get home. But first, I think we're gonna have some fun with this place.
(people screaming)
(townspeople chattering)
Merchant: Iced flies! Get your iced flies over here!
Anne: Carnie games? Fair food? Why can't it be like this all the time?
Polly: Welcome to Grubhog Day, Anne! It's the one day a year that no one works and the whole swamp cuts loose.
Frog: Whoo-hoo! (garbled mumbling)
Polly: It all leads up to a big ceremony where the grubhog pops out of his official stump!
Anne: And, let me guess, predicts the weather?
Polly: (gasps) How'd you know?
Anne: Believe it or not, we've got the same thing in my world.
Sprig: Grubhog, schmub hog. The best part of this holiday is the vomit-inducing, death-defying, unforgettable... rides!
Anne: That's what I'm talking about.
All: (laugh)
(Hop Pop jumps out of a bush.)
Hop Pop: Not so fast, kids!
Anne: Hop Pop, wha--What are you doing hiding in the bushes?
Hop Pop: Uh, I'm not quite sure myself, Anne. But never mind that. Great news! Ralphie Underbrook has the plague!
Anne: (gasps)
Polly: That's horrible!
Hop Pop: Oh, he'll be fine. But now, someone has to take care of the grubhog, and I volunteered you, Sprig.
Sprig: What?
Hop Pop: This is a big deal. The last Plantar to do it botched the job so bad, we shunned him for life.
Anne: Botched it?
Polly: Let's just say he got hungry. And he ate it.
Anne: Ew.
Hop Pop: Isn't this exciting? You'll have to miss the fair, of course, but it's for a good cause. Come on, boy. Do it for the family. What do you say?
Sprig: Well... I, uh...(groans)...Of course I will! There's nothing more important to me than family. Rides are for dum-dums anyway. (chuckles)
Hop Pop: That's my Sprig! I knew I could count on you. This guy, everyone! This guy!
Anne: Oh! He's so cute. Like a little sock puppet!
Hop Pop: Careful, It spits acid.
Grubhog: (oinks and spits acid)
Anne: (shouts)
Hop Pop: Don't stare into the abyss, Anne. After all, it stares back. You got that costume on yet, boy?
Sprig: (groans)
Hop Pop: I'm so happy I lived to see this.
Sprig (reading): "Congratulations, lucky child. Keep an eye on the grubhog, and don't pull a Plantar." Ouch.
Hop Pop: Polly, let's go spread the good news. The Plantars are back, baby! And just remember. The family name is in your hands.
Polly (echoing): In your haaaands.
Anne: All right, dude. What's going on? I know you don't wanna do this.
Sprig: (sighs) I don't. But I can't let Hop Pop down. He's counting on me.
Anne: Sprig, buddy, just tell Hop Pop how you really feel. Drop that truth bomb. (imitates explosion)
Sprig: No way. Those eyes he gave me earlier, those were "I'm proud of you, Sprig" eyes. I've only seen them maybe twice. So, you just go and enjoy those incredible rides without me.
Outside: (cheering)
Sprig: (gasps) Is that the Spider Spinner? I've heard it's the fastest ride ever made! (sighs) But I guess I'll have to miss it this year.
Grubhog: (oinks)
Anne: Hmm. Hey. What did that scroll say your one job was?
Sprig: To keep an eye on the grubhog.
Anne: So, why not keep an eye on him as he's sitting next to us? On a ride.
Sprig: You're a hopping genius, Anne!
Anne: As long as we're back here before the ceremony, what's the difference?
Sprig: But what if Hop Pop sees us out there?
Anne: He won't!
Sprig: This plan is flawless!
(upbeat music playing)
(both laugh)
(chuckle)
(cackles)
(both laugh)
(Grubhog starts to climb up the side of the merry-go-round.)
Anne: Oh, shoot. No, get back here.
(laughing)
(shouting)
(oinks)
(screaming, cheering)
Sprig: Yeah! This is amazing! Not only are we having fun, but I'm also doing Hop Pop proud!
Anne: In my world, we'd call this a win-win.
Sprig: Uh, we call it a win-win here too, Anne. (gasps) Look!
(frog screams)
Sprig: A new ride. Let's do it.
(grunts)
(both scream)
(grubhog squeals)
(Sprig yells)
(oinks)
(The grubhog falls of the roller coaster.)
Sprig: Hog overboard!
Anne: No, look! We can pick him up when we come back around. Ha-ha!
Both: It's gonna be okay!
(fanfare plays)
Anne: There he is!
(oinks, squeals)
(both gasp)
(A huge vulture swoops down and grabs the grubhog.)
(bird screeches)
(slows, clicks)
(shouts)
Anne: (gasping) Whoa, buddy. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Maybe we can go into the woods and find a new grubhog?
Sprig: The ceremony starts in five minutes!
(bell clangs)
Sprig: Hop Pop's gonna be so disappointed.
Anne: There's gotta be something we can do. Think!
Salesman: Socks, buttons. Don't know why you'd want them but we got 'em!
(Anne purchases materials and makes a sock puppet grubhog.)
Anne: There we go. Presenting... one grubhog!
(Anne squeals, snorts)
Sprig: Hmm, I don't know. He's a friendly little guy. Maybe...we can actually pull this off.
Anne: It's just gotta pop out of the stump, right?
Sprig: And predict the weather, yeah.
Anne: We totally got this!
(bell rings)
Announcer: The Grubhog Ceremony will begin presently.
Anne and Sprig: Let's do this thing.
(They fist bump, and an eye pops off the puppet.)
Anne: I can fix that.
(chattering)
(cheering, applause)
Sprig: (nervous laugh)
Toadstool: Frogs, friends. Welcome to the annual Grubhog Celebration!
Frog: Dang right!
Frog: Yeah!
Frog: Whoo-hoo!
Toadstool: Now, now, wait. Simmer down, simmer down. I-I now hand it over to the next town scandal just waiting to happen. Sprig Plantar!
(crowd grumbles)
Sprig: Hello. (clears throat) Welcome, fellow frogs. It is my honor to present the one, the only, the-absolutely-real and-not-fake grubhog!
(Anne, hidden inside the stump, pokes the sock grubhog out of the opening.)
Anne: (sniffs, snorts)
(cheering, applause)
Villager 1: Does the, uh, grubhog look a little bit off to you?
Villager 2: Uh, they probably changed its diet.
Villager 1: That's what it is.
Sprig: (quiet shout) I can't believe it! We're pulling this off!
Anne: (panting) Good, 'cause it's hot in here.
Toadstool: Cute and cuddly. He's here. And now, the ceremonial feeding and cleaning of the grubhog!
(applause)
Sprig: (gags, spits) Ow.
Hop Pop: (laughs) That's grubhog's got some sass in him. (chuckles)
Sprig: What are you doing?
Anne: Selling it.
(ragtime music)
(grunts)
Sprig: Huh? Ow.
(audience applauds)
(laughing)
Sprig: Oh, crud. Okay, you. Put 'em up.
(townspeople applauding)
(townspeople gasp)
(townspeople cheering)
(laughing)
Toadstool: Well done, my boy. Well done. I must say this is the best ceremony we've ever had. Consider the Plantar name restored in full!
(cheering)
Toadstool: And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. It's time to cut open the grubhog!
Anne: Uh, what now? Oh! Oh!
Toadstool: Now remember, spots in the liver means?
Crowd: Two more weeks of winter!
All: (chanting) Cut, cut!
Polly: I love this part!
Anne: Wait, you guys read its guts?
Sprig: I thought you had the same tradition back home!
Anne: It was a little different!
All: (chanting) Cut, cut, cut!
(shouts)
(shouts)
(shouts)
(Sprig grab's Toadstool's arm.)
(all gasp)
Toadstool: No, uh-- What's gotten into you, boy? Has the grubhog taken over your mind?
Sprig: I can't let you do this. The truth is...The truth is I lost the grubhog!
All: (gasp)
Toadtool: Leaping lily pads! What?
Sprig: That's right. I lost the grubhog because I was goofing off at the fair. Anne and I tricked you all to cover it up.
(He kicks the stump, which collapses and reveals Anne sitting inside.)
All: (gasp)
Anne (nervous): Hello, everybody.
Hop Pop: Sprig, I don't understand. I-I thought you said fixing the family name was important to you.
Sprig: I knew it was important to you. So, I played along. I just wanted to make you proud.
Hop Pop: Sprig, I owe you an apology.
Sprig: Huh?
Hop Pop: I put way too much on your shoulders. I should've just let you have fun at the fair.
Toadstool: Well, Plantars, you've ruined everything surprising absolutely no one. I knew this goofy kid would mess things up somehow.
Hop Pop: Hey, you make fun of me all you want, but you leave him out of this.
Toadstool: Wake up, Plantar! The night is ruined! We've got no grubhog. All we got is a puppet that everyone seemed to love!
Sprig: Chop the grubhog!
Anne: No! Chop you!
(Sprig yells)
Anne: Ree, ree, ree! Grubhog Two. The Reckoning! And, cue the applause.
Crowd (chanting): Puppets! Puppets! Puppets!
Hop Pop: Ten shows nightly. They can't get enough. Sprig, this puppet show is a great idea. You redeemed the family name after all. I'm proud of you. Both of you. That whole killing-the-grubhog stuff has always been pretty severe.
Polly: Not to me!
Toadstool (on speaker): And now, the moment y'all been waiting for. Let the show begin!
(applause)
Polly: To the VIP seats!
Sprig: Uh, hey, Anne? Thanks for sticking with me today. It was a ride I won't forget.
Anne: Anytime, dude. Real talk though, I almost peed myself when they were gonna cut off my arm.
Sprig: Yeah, memories. Too bad about that grubhog though. I hope he's in a better place.
(The grubhog, shown riding on top of the giant vulture, communicating through squawks and grunts.)
Grubhog: Thank you for saving me, loyal subject.
Vulture: Think nothing of it, Lord. I have not forgotten the aid you gave my people. To where do we fly?
Grubhog. To war, old friend. To war.
Hop Pop: Hmm.
Sylvia: Been a long time since I've danced with someone. Might be nice to feel the embrace of a man.
Felicia: (Chuckles, slightly embarrassed.) Mom.
Hop Pop: (stammers) Huh? (Suddenly being poked on the shoulder and back by a blue frog's hand.) Huh? Ooh!
Monroe: Ha-ha! Classic, gullible Hopediah!
Hop Pop: (Unamused.) Oh. Hey, Monroe.
Anne: (Observes from the alley.) Who's that?
Sprig: That's Monroe. He and Hop Pop have been rivals forever.
Polly: Monroe wins at pretty much everything. Lawn bowling, shuffleboard, other old man activities.
Monroe: You're not seriously thinking of going to this thing, are you? Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself like last year's barn dance fiasco. (laughs) See you around, old-timer.
Hop Pop: Oh, we'll see about that, Monroe. We'll see. (whistle blowing) Huh?
Sprig: Hop Pop, it's the fuzz! Everyone scatter! Aah!
(punching sounds)
Hop Pop: Can't dance, huh? We'll see about that. Looks easy enough. Sorry, Sylvia. And a-one, and a-two and--
(He takes out a mop, which breaks when he tries to dance with it.)
(shouts)
(sighs)
Hop Pop: Looks like it's hopeless.
(bass pounding)
Hop Pop: What in tarnation?
(pop music playing)
Hop Pop: Anne can dance?
(Anne shouts in alarm when she sees him and her shoe flies off.)
Hop Pop: Aah! Ow!
Anne: Hop Pop, what the heck, dude?
Hop Pop: Anne, I need your help.
Anne: What?
(He shows her the Dance Fever poster.)
Hop Pop: That's why I'm begging you. Teach me your ways! I can't tell Sylvia how I feel, but maybe I can show her by dancing with her.
Anne: Huh. Never figured you for a hopeless romantic, Hop Pop. Let's do this thing.
Hop Pop: Hey, um, think we could keep this just between us?
Anne: You got it, HP. My lips are sealed.
Sprig: Whoo! Dance it up, Hop Pop!
Polly: Shake that booty!
Hop Pop: What happened to the zipped lips?
Anne: Couldn't help it. This is just too juicy! Besides, when I'm done with you, you and Sylvia will be locking lips by the end of the night.
Sprig: (groans)
Polly: Oh, come on!
Anne: Lesson one. Footwork.
(Anne starts showing some of her moves; Hop Pop tries to replicate, but trips and falls onto an ant hill.)
(upbeat music playing)
(shouts)
(music stops)
(shouts)
Hop Pop: It burns! It burns!
(screams)
Anne: Lesson two. Rhythm.
Anne: (taps rhythmically)
Hop Pop: (taps off-beat)
Hop Pop: Ow!
Anne: Lesson three. Freestyle. Freestyle is expressing yourself in your own unique way.
Polly (looking at Hop Pop): Huh?
(Hop Pop grunting)
Hop Pop: (caws) Ta-da! Whoo! I gotta say, that's the first lesson I actually felt good--
Anne: Hop Pop, if you wanna win over Sylvia...Never do freestyle again!
 Sylvia I'm gonna win your heart Babe 
 When you see my froggy booty On the dance floor 
 Sylvia, you're tugging At my heartstrings 
Hop Pop: Here we go.
 Taking it out On the dance floor, babe 
Sprig: Whoa! Yeah, Hop Pop!
Polly: Miracles happen!
Anne: Nice work, Hop Pop. Or maybe I should call you "Hip Pop?"
Hop Pop: That reference means nothing to me.
Sprig: Guys, there's only ten minutes till the dance. Come on!
Anne: Oh, we gotta go!
(dancers chattering)
(gulps)
Sprig: I gotta say, as long as you're not being forced to date someone, dances ain't half bad.
Hop Pop: (gulps) She's here! I feel like I'm gonna faint. Can frogs faint? I don't know anything anymore!
Anne: Hop Pop, calm down. You are the king of this dance floor! You walk right up to that lovely lady and ask her to dance.
Hop Pop: Hmm! I got this.
Anne: Get it!
Hop Pop: (clears throat) S-S-Sylvia? Uh...
Monroe (cutting in front of him): Sylvia Sundew! Would you do me the honor of this dance?
Anne: What?
Sprig and Polly: (gasp)
Sylvia: Why, Monroe. I'd be delighted.
Hop Pop: (gasping) Sylvia! Dance with me instead!
Sylvia: Well, Hopediah.
Monroe: Him? Ha! He can't dance.
Hop Pop: I can dance better than you. I've been trained by the best, and I'm gonna take you down!
Monroe: Is that so? Then let's settle this.
(applause)
Anne, Sprig, Polly: (gasp)
Sprig: The drama.
Anne: Come on, guys. Hop Pop's gonna need backup.
Villager: Look over there.
Villager: What's going on?
Woman: Hopediah?
Man: It's a standoff.
Toadstool: Oh! What's this? It appears two stallions have taken to the floor and are about to battle it out!
(rhythm builds)
Hop Pop: Slick. Here we go. Look out. Ha!
(He performs a decent dance routine.)
Villager: You know, that wasn't half bad.
Villager: Technically proficient.
(cheering)
Toadstool: A solid effort by Hopediah Plantar! But how will Monroe respond?
Monroe: (chuckles)
All: (gasp)
Anne: Oh, no.
Monroe: Hold tight, now. Watch me now.
(He performs an excellent dance routine.)
(loud cheering)
Toadstool: Well, looks like that's it for Hopediah. Unless he has something special or unique to show.
Sprig: Well, we did our best. And isn't that what counts?
Polly: (shouts) What kinda loser talk is that?
Anne: I honestly don't know what to do. Monroe's just a better dancer.
Hop Pop: Well, then I guess I'll just have to express myself in my own unique way.
Sprig: Wait, you don't think he's gonna...
Anne: (gasps) Oh, no. Hop Pop! Hop Pop!
Hop Pop: Sylvia, I don't think I'll ever be able to tell you how I feel about you. But I can show you. Hit it, boys!
Band player: Uh, yeah. We've been hitting it, but okay.
(Hop Pop begins doing freestyle.)
(sighs)
(caws)
(caws, gags)
Toadstool: Unbelievable!
(dancers gasp)
Toadstool: I ain't never seen moves like those. It's horrifying.
(hooting)
(screams)
Hop Pop: Ta-da!
All: (gasps)
Anne (face covered): Is it safe to look yet?
Sprig (face covered): No idea.
Polly (face covered): Couldn't tell you.
Monroe: Oho, yikes. Well, I think it's clear who the winner is.
Villager: It's Monroe.
Villager: Not even close.
Villager: Monroe does it again!
Monroe: Come along, Sylvia. No need to waste time with losers.
Hop Pop: Oh.
Polly, Sprig, Anne: (sigh)
Sylvia: Oh, Hopediah!
Hop Pop: Huh?
(Sylvia starts doing freestyle.)
(grunting, humming)
(gurgles)
All: Ooh!
Monroe: Wha--She's as freaky as he is! The horror!
(Hop Pop joins her.)
(croaking)
Woman: This is not for children's eyes!
Anne: Why? Why?
Toadstool: Okay! That's enough of that. Pack it up. Dance is over! Everyone go home!
(Hop Pop and Sylvia stop dancing, panting and laughing.)
Hop Pop: I don't get it. Why?
Sylvia: I have a soft spot for the weird ones, remember?
Hop Pop: (stammers) Ah, shame the dance is over. I could dance for hours with you.
(Sprig starts playing smooth violin.)
Hop Pop: Ahem, may I have this dance, Sylvia Sundew?
Sylvia: Why, yes you may, Hopediah Plantar.
Polly: May I have this dance, madame?
Anne: Thought you'd never ask.
Hop Pop: Ah, Theater night. The one night a month we come together, watch our stories, and forget all our horrible, horrible troubles.
All: (sigh)
Hop Pop: Now who wants popcorn?
Anne: Oh, me, me!
Polly: I do!
Arguing frogs: My seat!
Lavender, Ginger, and Rosemary: (chanting) Theater night, theater night!
Sprig (looking for a seat): Oh! Right in the middle! Dibs!
Polly: That seat is mine!
Sprig: Not if I get there first.
Polly: Oh! (gasps)
Sprig: Boom!
Polly: No fair. You have appendages.
Hop Pop: Tut-tut. Sprig, give Polly the seat.
Sprig: Say what? Come on, Hop Pop. I got here first. (grunts)
Hop Pop: That's what older brothers do, Sprig. They look out for their little sisters. Now, move that rump over to that stump.
Sprig: (gasps; groans)
Anne: Bummer, dude.
Sprig: (sighs) It's just not fair. Just because she's a little younger, she always gets special treatment.
Anne: I'm an only child, so I don't relate. All my parents' attention was focused on me. And it was... awesome.
Sprig: (blows raspberry) Lucky you.
Toadstool: All right, now. Everybody settle down. I have some bad news. The acting troupe had to cancel on account of...well, being eaten on the way here.
All: (booing)
Mrs. Croaker: We need our stories!
Anne: Hold up, everyone. I have something that might work. It's called a "movie." It's like a play, but totally better.
(crowd murmuring)
Villager: A moovie.
(Anne props her phone against her shoe onstage as a frog places a giant glass panel in front to magnify the screen.)
Anne: Thanks, Chad, local glass artisan.
Chad: Yep.
Anne: Okay, so tonight I'm going to be showing the timeless classic Love Choice, which has always been one of my favorites because--
Mrs. Croaker: Just start the movie!
Anne: (laughs) You got it.
(Presses button, the movie doesn't start)
Anne: Dang it.
(Presses button again, this time it works)
Narrator: In the not so distant future, three grounded yet supernatural teens must navigate their feelings if they hope to survive.
Hop Pop: Wait, how could they be both grounded and supernatural?
Anne: (shushes)
Constance: Oh, Hunter. I know that together we'll make it through this nightmare.
Hunter: Constance, my cybernetic abs belong to you and you alone.
(techno music plays)
(crowd murmurs)
Polly: Hmm, Polly likey.
Constance: I know I said I liked Hunter, but I can't help but be drawn to you as well, Alastair.
Alastair: May I sing you the traditional song of my people?
(shrieking)
Sprig: I like this Alastair. He's ethereal, yet approachable.
Constance: It is now time for me to make my love choice. I choose... I choose...
(bird shrieks and grabs her)
(screams)
Hunter: Constance!
(flute music)
Alastair: We must go after her!
Both: I'll save you, Constance!
Narrator: To be continued...
(audience gasps)
Mrs. Croaker: What? That was the end?
Wally: Who did she pick? I'm so frustrated right now!
Anne: Believe me, guys. Been there. They are making a sequel, Love Choice 2, but it's not out yet.
Polly: I'll tell you who she picks! Hunter! He's a beefcake.
Sprig: What? She should pick Alastair. He's a thinker. A dreamer.
(crowd clamoring)
Polly: Listen up! I don't even want to live in a town with someone who likes Alastair.
Sprig: Well, I don't want to live in a town with someone who likes Hunter.
Polly: That does it! Everybody who chooses Hunter, get behind me!
Wally: Yeah!
Toadie: He looks strong.
Felicia: He's so attractive.
Sprig: Well, anyone who likes Alastair can get behind me!
Mrs. Croaker: Alastair's my man!
Villager: Definitely Alastair.
Hop Pop: Excuse me, pardon me.
Mrs. Croaker: Hey!
Hop Pop: Sprig, just let Polly win this one, before things get even worse.
Sprig: Sorry, Hop Pop. But I've had it with this pollywog and her special treatment. We ain't backing down!
Polly: This means war!
(crowds shouting indistinctly; both sides exit)
Anne: I have a bad feeling about this.
Hop Pop: Eh, I'm sure by morning clearer heads will prevail.
(The next day; the town is split in half, with roofs of buildings painted red or purple for Hunter or Alastair.)
Hop Pop: Or, you know, not.
Anne: I don't believe this. The town is split right down the middle.
All: (chanting) Hail Alastair!
Sprig: Hmm...
All: (chanting) Hail Hunter!
Polly: Hmm...
Anne: This is just like an Internet message board...but IRL.
Hop Pop: Were things on this "Internet" resolved in peaceful and civilized ways?
Anne: See for yourself, dude.
Hunter frog: Oh, gosh. I forgot my house is over in Alastairtown. Ow! Ow!
Alastair frog: Take that, you stinking Hunterite.
(laughs)
(laughing)
Anne: If we don't do something fast, this whole town is going to tear itself apart.
Hop Pop: Polly and Sprig are the ringleaders. If we can just get them to get along, we'll be fine.
Sprig: (shrieking)
Female frog: Amazing, Leader Sprig.
Male frog: You have the voice of an angel.
Stumpy: Deer Sprig, you have a visitor.
Mrs. Croaker: Should we throw her in the deer prison?
Sprig: No, no. It's okay. Thank you, Deer Stumpy and Deer Croaker. Take five, deer friends.
All: Mmm.
Sprig: Anne, great to see ya. Are you here to join our deer choir?
Anne: Nope. I'm here to tell you this dumb feud with Polly is dumb. And you need to end it. Just let her have this one, dude.
Sprig: You're an only child, Anne. You don't understand. I'm always giving up things for Polly. Well, no more! The only way to end this is if Polly submits to me!
Anne: But--
Sprig: We're done here.
(Plays panpipes - Maddie and Toadstool jump out of nearby bushes and grab Anne.)
Maddie: Ha!
Toadstool: (groans) Got you.
Anne: Oh, come on. This isn't cool, Sprig. This isn't cool!
Sprig: That's Deer Sprig to you.
Toadstool: And stay out of Alastairville.
Hop Pop: Anne! Polly's not budging. She won't even see Sprig till he surrenders. Not only that, but they graffitied my tum-tum. Any luck on your end?
Anne: Nope.
Hop Pop: How are those kids supposed to make up if they won't even see one another?
Anne: I know, right? We've got to get them together. But how...Hey, Hop Pop. You ever play capture the flag?
Alastair frog: So I named my kid Alastair last night.
Alastair frog: Wow, you're a good dad.
Anne: (Hops out of pipe and starts cutting down flagpole)
Sprig(to Mrs. Croaker): Personally, my favorite thing about Alastair is how he's not afraid to cry.
Mrs. Croaker: (screams)
Sprig: No! She's stealing the sacred flag! Quick, sound the alarm!
Anne: (panting) Uh-oh.
Hunter frog: Chief Polly, an old man is climbing the flagpole.
Polly: Somebody get him!
Toadie: For Hunter!
Hop Pop: Ha! Got it! (laughs) Anne, you did it!
Toadie: Got you!
Hop Pop: (Kicks him away - he falls to the ground.)
Toadie: For Hunter!
Hop Pop: Eh, he'll be fine. (He uses the flag as a parachute.) Whee!
Anne: (panting) No Hop Pop yet. Oh, man. I hope he was able to get the flag--
Hop Pop: Watch out! (He bumps into Anne.)
Anne: Ow! Whoo! Both flags captured!
Hop Pop: Now what?
Anne: Now this.
(crowd clamoring)
Anne: Ha ha! Tricked you all! Now that you're face-to-face, how about discussing this like civilized--Whoa!
Polly: So, older brother, you here to finally admit I'm right and surrender to the...Hunter tribe?
Sprig: Death first!
Polly: Then perish!
(Both sides begin throwing fruit.)
(all grunting)
(groans)
Sprig: Take this, you brutes!
Anne: Well, at least we brought them together to clear the air, right?
Hop Pop: Too bad they couldn't--(gasps)
Anne: Aah!
Sprig: Retreat, my dear brethren!
Polly: (laughs) After those wimpy deer cowards!
Crowd: Hail Hunter!
Polly: Wait...Something's off.
Hunter Frog: Aah!
Hunter Frog: Ow!
Polly: It's a trap!
Sprig: (laughing) Ambush!
(panting, grunting)
(Polly goes down an alley and gets trapped; the Alastair clan are on both sides with fruit.)
Sprig: You lose, Polly. Looks like your special treatment couldn't help you this time. Now just surrender--
Mrs. Croaker: Enough talk! Let her have it!
Sprig: Uh, what?
Toadstool: Incoming!
(shouting)
(Fruit flies towards Polly.)
Hop Pop's voice: That's what older brothers do, Sprig. They look out for their little sisters.
Polly: (shudders)
Sprig: Uh...What have I done?
Sprig: No!
(He jumps in front of Polly; the fruit hits him instead.)
(splattering)
(grunting)
(crowd gasping)
(Sprig groans)
Polly: (crying) Why, Sprig? I don't understand. Why?
Sprig: Because seeing you in danger made me realize...it doesn't matter what's fair. What matters is that I'm here to take care of you. We surrender, Polly. (coughs) We... surrender.
Polly: Brother...No...No!(crying)
(Dramatic music)
Sprig: Hoo! All right, folks. Pack it in, we're done.
Polly: Yeah, this thing is pretty played out.
(crowd cheering)
Anne: Wait, what?
Villager(dragging away a cannon): Glad I finally got a chance to use this bad boy.
Mrs. Croaker: Now, that was exciting.
Anne: You guys were at each other's throats just a second ago. Are you seriously over this already?
Hop Pop: Oh, that's just the way we are, Anne. You should have seen last year's avocados versus almonds fiasco. We almost tore this place to the ground.
Mrs. Croaker: Whew, good thing it's over. I don't even remember what we were fighting about.
Sprig: I can't believe we almost killed each other over a work of fiction.
Polly: I know, right? Can we watch another one?
Sprig: Hmm...
Polly: Hey, Sprig! Over here! I saved you a spot.
Sprig: And I brought you some sweets.
Polly: You're a good older brother, Sprig.
Hop Pop: Aww, well, ain't that nice. Now scooch over. I need a seat.
Anne: Hello, everyone! For tonight, I've picked a conflict-free independent film called My Dinner with Anders. But before we start, a little context.
Crowd: Just start the movie!
Anne: (laughs) You got it.
(Clicks the button.)
(At the Plantar home, Anne, Sprig and Polly enter the house.)
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop! Got the groceries!
Polly: Couldn't buy much since we've barely got any money left.
Sprig: Feeling any better, Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: (sighs) No. Ever since we lost the vegetable stand I've just felt, well, lost. I was fine the first couple of days, but it's really starting to catch up with me.
Anne: Well, maybe this will cheer you up. Pa-pow!
Sprig: The Grub-N-Go's hiring greeters! All you gotta do is smile and be friendly.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Just another job for me to lose.
Sprig (dragging him off the couch): See? You're a natural.
Anne: Now head out there and get back in the game.
Hop Pop: Lemme go! The couch is the only one who understands me!
Male Frog: Thank you, Mr. Plantar. Don't call us, we'll call you.
(crowd clamoring)
Villager: Got to get ready!
Hop Pop: What's all this rabble?
Wally: Sign-ups for the election! You been living under a rock? 'Cause I have and even I knew that.
Hop Pop: Election?
Toadstool: Vote Mayor Toadstool! If reelected, I will always look out for the little guy.
(Toadie squeaks as Toadstool uses him as a stool.)
Toadstool: Upsy-daisy.
(engine roars)
Child: (Coughing in the dust)
Hop Pop: (scoffs) Some mayor. That guy keeps raising our taxes, and what do we got to show for it? Our snail-ways are a mess. Our buildings are falling apart. Heck, we ain't even replaced the schoolhouse after last year's millipede incident!
(children screaming)
(roaring)
Felicia: Am I crazy, or is he making sense?
Hop Pop: Maybe we need a mayor who looks out for the people he's mayoring. 'Cause ours, well...(chuckles) He's only looking out for himself. Anyway, good afternoon, everybody.
Wally: I nominate Hopediah Plantar for mayor!
Felicia: I second that!
Villager: I third it.
Villager: Let's hear it for Hopediah!
Villager: Sounds good to me.
Felicia: Hop Pop for mayor, everyone.
(cheering, applause)
Hop Pop: Huh?
(Back at the Plantar Farm)
Hop Pop: Guess what, kids!
Anne: You passed the interview?
Sprig: You got the job?
Hop Pop: Nope! I'm running for mayor.
All: Huh?
Hop Pop: Don't you see, kids? If I win this election, I'll prove once and for all that Hopediah Plantar ain't no loser!
Anne: Oh, no. If he loses, he'll be more down than ever.
Polly: And we just got the couch cleaned.
Sprig: But if he wins maybe we'll get the old Hop Pop back!
Polly: True that.
Anne: Fair point. Hop Pop, we're all in!
Hop Pop: Really? Aw, kids. I won't let you down. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom practicing my distinguished expression! (laughs)
Anne: Ugh. Politics are the worst.
Polly: Yeah. The monster fights are pretty cool, though.
Anne: The what now?
(cheering)
Toadstool: You've made a powerful enemy today, Hopediah. Toads have run uncontested for decades. This is a disgrace.
Hop Pop: The only disgrace is you as mayor.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, I like this Hopediah.
Villager: I don't know. Toadstool is tried and true.
Albus Duckweed: Ahem! Welcome to the official mayoral trials, where the candidates try to win your vote.
Anne: I'm suddenly very interested in politics. (Blows horn loudly.)
Sprig: Okay, Anne. That's enough.
Duckweed: Our first trial is all about strength. The first candidate to mount the beetle wins!
(whistles)
(beetle roars)
Duckweed: Ready, set, go!
Toadstool: (grunting) Oh, my giblets! I've got you! No, I don't!
(growling)
Hop Pop: Hey! (laughing) Come and get it.
Beetle: (shrieks)
(cheering, applause)
Duckweed: The second trial is about sensitivity. Can you figure out what these hatchlings need? A good mayor would.
Toadstool: I know what these dumb birds want. Money. All right, all right. Here's your handout.
(He throws a handful of coins at them; they begin pecking him.)
(screeching)
Toadstool: (grunting) Oh! Oh!
Toadie: There, there, sir.
Hop Pop: Hmm...
(He feeds them some worms.)
Birds: (chirping)
Hop Pop: (laughs)
Crowd: Aww...
Sprig (to Anne): That's how he fed us when we were babies.
(The mother bird suddenly returns; all run off screaming.)
Duckweed: Being mayor is a lot like being dropped in the woods naked and forced to find your way home. So that's what we did!
Crowd: (gasps)
Hop Pop: Thanks for showing me the way, Jeremy.
Jeremy: (chirping)
Hop Pop: Safe travels, brother.
(crowd cheering)
Polly: Yeah! Whoo!
All: (chanting) Hop Pop! Hop Pop!
Toadstool: This is getting out of hand, Toadie. I could actually lose! Looks like we'll have to stop him... Ow! the old-fashioned way. Illegally.
(The Plantar farm, night.)
Sprig: Excited for the final trial tomorrow, Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Not really. I know I've been doing well, but if I mess up tomorrow, it could cost us the election.
(knocking)
Toadie: Mr. Plantar, an anonymous associate would like to speak with you.
Anne: You mean the mayor?
Toadie: No comment.
Anne: Come on, dude, you only know like one person!
Toadie: I said no comment!
(Inside Toadstool's wagon)
Toadstool: Ah, so glad you could join me, Plantar. I'll give it to you straight. I want you to lose tomorrow's trial.
Hop Pop: Well, yeah. I figured.
Toadstool: No, you dimwit, lose on purpose! In return, I'll give you a new vegetable stand. Heck, I'll put it in the center of the market, tax free! You'll make tons of money.
Hop Pop: That's, uh...hard to say no to.
Toadstool: Well, then, don't.
(Hop Pop enters the house)
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: (sighs)
Anne: So, uh, what did the mayor want?
Hop Pop: If I lose on purpose, Toadstool will give us the stand back.
Sprig and Polly: (both gasp)
Anne: What? No! You've got a real chance to win.
Hop Pop: He'll also make us rich. We'd be set for life.
Polly: Oh, in that case, take the deal.
Anne and Sprig: (both) Polly!
Polly: We were all thinking it!
Hop Pop: (sighs) Polly's right, guys. It's just too good to pass up.
Anne: Well, whatever you pick, we'll be behind you, dude.
Sprig: All the way.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. (sighs) Guess I've got some thinking to do.
Duckweed: Ladies and gentlephibians, you know the candidates, you've seen 'em fight monsters. But for the final challenge, you'll see them fight...each other!
(applause)
Toadie: Ah!
Duckweed: Now you both know the rules. Fight starts as soon as the bell rings.
Old frog: What? Ring the bell?
(bell rings)
(They begin boxing.)
(grunts)
(groans)
Duckweed: Ah!
(groans)
(cheering)
(chuckles)
Toadtool: Ah! (grunts)
(gasping)
Toadstool: Ow! Okay, Plantar! You've put on a good show but... that's enough!
Hop Pop: This can't be good.
(grunting)
(crowd groans)
(crowd gasps)
Toadstool: Like we talked about. Stay down, Plantar.
Crowd: (distorted) Get up!
Anne: You can do it!
Sprig: Come on, Hop Pop!
Toadstool: Stay down!
(groaning)
(Hop Pop gets up.)
Toadstool: What are you, crazy? You could have been rich. You could've had your stand back. All you had to do was give up! (panting) Why?
Hop Pop: Because this is about more than just me!
(He punches Toadstool.)
Toadstool: (groans)
Duckweed: That's a knockout!
Old frog: Huh? Ring the bell!
(bell rings)
(cheering, applause)
Crowd: Hop Pop! Yeah! Whoo!
Duckweed: Well, folks, that wraps up the trials. Now it's time to tally the votes! With 88 votes, 100% of Wartwood, Hopediah Plantar!
Hop Pop: What? I won?
Duckweed: And with 22,000 votes, the entire rest of the Valley, Mayor Toadstool!
Hop Pop: What?
Duckweed: Congratulations, sir.
Toadstool: Thank you. Thank you all. You're all too kind. Democracy wins again!
(crowd groaning)
Toadstool: Well, you certainly gave this toad a run for his money. Good thing you didn't win though, huh? (laughs) A frog beating a toad. That would have made headlines! Just be proud the whole town loved ya. I'm surprised the rest of the valley didn't.
Hop Pop: How was I supposed to know the rest of the valley got a vote? I'm a theater major, for cricket's sake!
Toadstool: Wait, wait now. You didn't campaign outside Wartwood? Oh, son. That's just sad. Really is. Almost takes the joy out of my victory.
Toadie: The victory pinata is all set up in the lobby, sir.
Toadstool: Well, I did say "almost." Wahoo! Pinata! I'm gonna hit it.
Sprig: Hey, Hop Pop...You okay?
Hop Pop: Yep! I've never felt better!
Sprig: Huh?
Anne: Really? You know you lost, right? Are you in shock? Is he in shock?
Hop Pop: I may have lost, but I stood my ground and fought for something important. And that feels good.
Wally: Hopediah? Uh, may we have a word?
Felicia: We all pitched in and built you a stand. For giving us something better than produce...
Wally: Hope.
Mrs. Croaker: You've made us all proud.
Hop Pop: I may have lost the race, but I'm back at the market with all of you. And that makes me a winner. This is perfect. I wouldn't have put the root vegetables with the tubers, though. It's not important. (beat) I'll fix it later.
(It's almost dawn and Anne's sitting outside the Plantar home drinking tea as the sun rises.)
(rooster crows)
Anne: (yawns) Ahh.
Sprig: Anne! Anne! Anne! An--
(Anne, continuing sipping her drink, raises her finger and Sprig stops to wait. She gulps and points for him to proceed.)
Sprig: Anne! Anne! Anne! Look what I found! A blue moon shell.
Anne: Pretty.
Sprig: Yup! And you know who's gonna love it? Ivy! Tomorrow's her birthday. And this is the perfect gift.
Hop Pop: Morning, kids! Time to start the chores. Whoa! Is that a blue moon shell? (gasps) Beautiful! You know, some frogs die never having seen one.
Polly: (laughs) Suckers!
Hop Pop: Anyway, enough dilly-dallying. Chore time! Bessie's waste ain't gonna shovel itself.
Sprig: Well, don't wanna get this thing dirty. (whistles)
Anne: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're just gonna leave that there? Someone's gonna steal it.
Sprig: No, they won't. This is Wartwood, Anne, not some den of thieves.
Anne: You could at least cover it up or something.
Sprig: I will do no such thing! I trust my community. And frankly, Anne, I pity you for not trusting yours.
Anne: Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Hop Pop: Kids, get your butts over here!
Sprig and Anne: Coming, Hop Pop.
(Sometime later, Anne and Sprig return to the front door.)
Sprig: Glad that's over with.
Anne: Well, I'm scarred for life.
Sprig: Yup. But never mind that. Look. The blue moon shell. Right where I left it. Wait. Wait a minute. What? The shell. The shell's not here. I've been robbed!
Anne: Well, I don't wanna tell you, "I told you so." But--
Sprig: (sobs) Ivy's birthday is tomorrow, and I've got nothing. (sobs, pants)
Anne: Okay, first, calm down.
Sprig: (breathes heavily)
Anne: Second, maybe we can track this thief down. Quick. Look for clues. Well, well, well. What do we have here?
Sprig: Oh, that's just waxed yarn. They sell it at the Grub and Go.
Anne: Well, then, let's grub and go there to catch our thief.
Sprig: (chuckles) Nice.
Anne: Finally, hundreds of hours of watching trash cop shows is gonna pay off.
Sprig: Cop, what?
Anne: You know. A cop, po-po, five-oh, doughnut munchers?
Sprig: Mmm.
Anne: Here. (She shows Sprig a trailer for a police show on her phone.)
(police siren wails)
Police chief: I don't care what it takes! Bring him to me, dead or alive!
(police siren wails)
Investigator 1: One knife victim without pants. We've gotta catch this sicko.
Investigator 2: So, you're a marathon runner, eh?
Investigator 1: Well, maybe this will jog your memory. Jelly-stained boxers found at the scene of the crime.
(gunshot fires)
Criminal: How'd you get my phone number?
Investigator 1: Easy.
Criminal: (gasps)
Investigator 1: I looked up "guilty" in the phone book.
Police officer: (chews donut)
Narrator: Justice is watching you.
(bullet ricochets)
Sprig: Whoa! I'm into this.
Anne: Who wouldn't be? Now let's go catch that thief.
(Anne and Sprig appear walking in town, wearing fake mustaches.)
Sprig: Ow! Whoops. Why are we wearing these again?
Anne: All the best cops have mustaches. Now, here's how it's gonna go. I'm the good cop. So I'll butter 'em up and make 'em lower their guard. Then bam-o! You come in as the bad cop and get the confession.
Sprig: Got it.
(store bell rings)
Anne: Hey, buddy. Nice little place you got here. Business good?
Teenage worker: Um, we're having kind of a rough season.
Anne: Good, good. We're here about a shell that got misplaced. Recognize any of these?
Teenage worker: Huh. Couldn't say. I see a lot of shells.
Anne (to Sprig): Psst. Hit him with the "bad cop."
Sprig: Oh, right. (To the worker) Your hair looks incredible. (grunts)
Teenage worker: Thanks. I use product.
Anne: (to Sprig): Sergeant, could I speak to you for a moment?
Anne: Sprig, that wasn't bad cop. That was sad cop. You gotta get mad, man!
Sprig: Yeah, I'm not generally a mad kid, Anne.
Anne: You gotta dig deep, dude. Think about what that thief took from you. Your shell. Your gift. Your future with Ivy. The frog of your dreams!
Sprig: (groans)
Anne: Yes. Yes, Sprig. Let it flow!
Sprig: (to the worker): (grumbles, yells) Hey, you little noodle! This blue shell, you seen it?
Teenage worker: Yes! Yes! I remember now! Out there. Late morning!
Sprig: Great. Now, who buys this string?
Teenage worker: Uh, no one except the baker, really.
Anne: The baker, huh? You have a nice day, sir. (Grabs a bag of donuts and puts a coin on the counter.) Keep the change, kid.
Teenage worker: Actually, you're short.
Anne: Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Anne: All right, same drill. Good cop, bad cop time.
Sprig: Got it.
(store bell rings)
Anne: Well, howdy there, baker. Nice pile of bricks you got here. Listen I wanted to ask you--
Sprig: (yells) Where's my shell?
Mr. Flour: (grunts)
Anne: Whoa, dude. What are you doing?
Mr. Flour: (grunts) Shell? What shell?
Sprig: This string was found at the scene of a crime. And only you use it. Talk!
Mr. Flour: (groans) I wrap my buguettes in that.
Anne: So whoever bought a loaf is a suspect.
Mr. Flour: (nodding frantically) Uh-huh.
Sprig: (grunts, hits him)
Mr. Flour: Whoa!
Sprig: I want names, you worm.
Mr. Flour: (shudders) Baker's oath. Customer list, confidential.
Sprig: Hmm. (Grabs an apron off the wall, embroidered with the words 'My Favorite Apron'.) Your favorite apron, right? Sure would be a shame if something (holds it over fireplace) happened to it.
Mr. Flour: (gasps) No, not my favorite apron.
Anne: Sprig!
Mr. Flour: (groans) Oh. Here. (Hands over list.)
Sprig: There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
Mr. Flour(hugging the apron): Oh! My baby! My baby!
Anne: Uh, sorry about that. He's new to this.
Mr. Flour(to the apron): It's okay, baby. Daddy's here.
Sprig: (loud munching)
Anne: So...that was a little too much bad cop.
Sprig: Well, we got results, didn't we?
Anne: Well, yeah. But--
Sprig: Then let's stop wasting time and find who stole my shell already! (sips) Actually, there's nothing in here.
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Stumpy?
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Croaker?
Mrs. Croaker: (shouts)
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Toadstool?
Toadie: Sir, please help me.
Toadstool: Just let it happen, Toadie.
Sprig: (grunts)
Anne: Dude, there's no one here.
Sprig: I know! I'm just fired up, Anne.
(children laugh)
Sprig: You were right. This town is a dirty cesspool of vice. (munches) Disgusting.
Anne: Look, I'm glad you're being more cautious. But I think this whole thing has gotten a little extreme.
Sprig: Justice is extreme, Anne! (pants) Besides, we only have one name left on our list. Which means...we've got our guy.
Anne(reading the name): Gunther? Who's that?
Sprig: He just moved to Wartwood. Lives out in the woods. Seemed nice. A little too nice.
Anne(looking at Gunther's house a few minutes later): Yeah. Sprig, I don't think we should--Sprig!
Sprig(knocking on the door): Gunther, open up!
Anne: Sprig!
Sprig: Come on! Help me break the door down!
Anne: Nope.
Sprig: Yep!
Anne: No! (gags) Bad frog.
(groans, yells, grunts)
(Gunther's door opens.)
Gunther: Oh, can I help you children?
Sprig: We'll be the ones asking questions.
Anne(covering Sprig's mouth): Hey. We're just a couple of curious kiddos knocking on doors and saying hello.
Gunther: Well, isn't that nice?
Anne: Yeah. Just wondering, what brings you here to Wartwood?
Gunther: Well, I'm from down south. But I had to leave due to an unfortunate misunderstanding.
Sprig: Oh. Was it because you're a criminal?
Gunther: Excuse me?
Sprig: Don't play dumb with us! We know that shell's in here somewhere! (Storms into the house.)
Gunther: Shell?
Sprig: Is it here? (Smashes vase.)
Gunther: Hey!
Sprig: Or maybe here? (Smashes carriage clock.)
Gunther: Stop that!
Sprig: Where are you hiding it? (Rips pillow.)
Gunther: Get out of my house! (growls)
Anne: Uh, Sprig, why is he changing color?
Sprig: I don't know. The only frogs who can do that are southern tusk frogs. But Gunther doesn't have any tusks.
Gunther: (Roars and sprouts tusks.)
Sprig: Oh, there they are.
Gunther: (growls)
Sprig: Think we touched a nerve there.
Gunther: I kill you!
Anne: Run!
(growls)
(pants)
(growls)
Sprig: We gotta hide somewhere. Stumpy! Stumpy! Stumpy! Stumpy!
Stumpy: What do you want?
Sprig: We're being chased.
Anne: There's a big monster.
Both: He's gonna kill us!
Stumpy: You think I'm gonna let you in here after you called me a thief?
Anne: Maybe?
(He slams the door.)
(growls)
(roars)
(yells)
Sprig: He's crazy.
Anne: You gotta let us in.
Both: He's gonna kill us.
(Mrs. Croaker slams door too.)
Anne: He's after us.
Sprig: You've gotta help.
Anne: Please let us in.
(Mr. Flour closes window.)
Sprig: Toadie, buddy.
(Toadie kicks them down the stairs.)
(both yell)
(both grunt)
Sprig: Anne, I think I did too much bad cop.
Anne: You think?
(growls)
Sprig: Then maybe it's time this bad cop goes good. (Rips off mustache.) Oh, that really hurts.
Gunther: (growls) Huh?
Sprig: Gunther, wait. I shouldn't have accused you like that.
Gunther: (growls repeatedly)
Sprig: I don't really know you. And you've never given me any reason not to trust you. I guess I just hopped to conclusions.
Gunther: (laughs) Hopped.
Sprig: (chuckles) Yeah. 'Cause I'm a frog. Well, anyways, I wanted you to have these. (Hands over the bag of donuts.)
Gunther: Aw!
Sprig: We ate most of them. But there's, like, three left.
Gunther: (groans) Thank you, child. Rage problems. You know how it is. People misjudge me all the time since I can turn into a hulking beast. And it's super annoying, hmm.
Sprig: Well, hey, I promise I won't judge you anymore.
Anne: Yeah, dude. Sorry about that.
Gunther: Ooh, chocolate. (munches)
Sprig: Actually, that's licorice.
Gunther: (groans) I hate licorice! (He starts chasing them again.)
(growls)
(both yell)
Both: (sighs)
Anne: Man, that guy was hard to lose.
Sprig: I don't believe this. Went through all that and we still haven't found the--(gasps) Shell! (The shell is sitting on the fence. Ivy drops down next to it.)
Ivy: Hey, Sprig.
Sprig: Ivy?
Ivy: I came by earlier, but I couldn't find you. But I did find this sweet blue moon shell.
Sprig: And you... took it?
Ivy: Yeah. It was a little dirty. But I took it home and polished it up. Here's it back.
Sprig: Uh, thanks.
Anne: Go get her.
Sprig: Oh, right. Happy early birthday, Ivy.
Ivy: Whoa. Thanks, Sprig. It's beautiful. But I kinda like it here. When I see it sparkle, I know I'm getting close to your place.
Sprig: (stammers) Wow! (blows raspberry) Okay.
Anne: (gasps) Aw!
Sprig: Cut it out!
Ivy: Well, see you dorks later.
Anne: See you, Ivy! Well, looks like we found our thief.
Sprig: Yes, Anne. But she didn't just steal the shell. She stole my heart.
(sweeping music plays)
(music stops)
Sprig: Too much?
Anne: Little bit, yeah.
Sprig: Got it.
Hop Pop: Now, remember, gang. The mountain pass will clear up in one week. Meaning, it's almost time to leave this valley and find Anne a way home.
Anne: Whoo! Love that!
Sprig: Excitement!
Polly: Sights!
Hop Pop: And you know the best way to start a quest?
Sprig: Danger?
Polly: Weapons?
Hop Pop: Research!
All: (groans)
Hop Pop: Oh, come on, gang. We'll never get Anne home if we get bitten to death by a venomous snake fly.
Nearby snake fly: (hisses)
Hop Pop: Or eaten to death by a camouflaged sod skink.
(A sod skink appears and kills the snake fly.)
Hop Pop: Or crushed to death by a sand liger.
(A sand liger appears and kills the sod skink.)
Sand liger: (roars)
Anne: Okay, okay, okay. Enough death already. Sheesh. I'm beginning to think you guys are obsessed.
Sprig: (groans) The town archives? (grunts) This place is dustier than Dusty's dustbin.
Polly: Who?
Sprig: Come on. You know Dusty. Local dust merchant. Friendly, always smiling, sells dust.
Polly: Oh, yeah, yeah. Right.
Anne: I get this place. It's like a library from my world. Zoobooks and manga, here I come!
Hop Pop: Enough chatter, you three. Time to hit the books.
Sprig: Wait! Wouldn't we be better off preparing by diving headfirst into deadly situations?
Anne: Huh. Yeah. Maybe Sprig's right, Hop Pop. Research is overrated.
Hop Pop: Overrated, eh? How's diving into adventure been working out so far?
Anne: Hmm.
(Flashback of Anne and Sprig hiding from a fire-breathing giant mole.)
Mole: (roars)
Anne and Sprig: (screams)
(Flashback of Bessie caught in a mudslide.)
All: (screams)
(Flashback of all four tied up under a giant skunk.)
All: (screams)
Anne: No, no, no, no, no!
Polly: I can still smell that skunk juice. (shudders with Anne)
Anne: Yeah. Fair enough. Research it is.
Sprig: What? You're siding with Hop Pop?
Anne: This trip is gonna take us beyond the valley, Sprig. Who knows what we'll run into out there? (She bangs her head on the low door.) Ow.
Sprig: (groans)
(They go inside.)
Anne: (whistles)
Sprig: (grunts) The archives.
Anne: This place seems pretty cool to me.
Sprig: Sure, it seems cool, until you realize all you do here is read other people's cool adventures.
Hop Pop: Okay, enough prattle. We gotta get a move on before we're locked in here.
Anne: Uh, come again?
Hop Pop: The door to this place is set on a sunlight timer. It opens when the sun rises and deadlocks when the sun sets.
Anne: That is some steampunk-y nonsense right there.
Sprig: (groans) Boring old books smelling like dumb old words.
Anne(reading): "Mycroft Newtback, archives founder. This structure, originally Newtback's home, was turned into the public archives after he died violently attempting to travel beyond the valley."
(All straighten.)
Anne: I'm gonna go hit those books.
Polly: Uh, reading time.
Sprig: Better get to it.
Hop Pop: Get my hands on those books.
Hop Pop: "Only nature facts." Fair. Well, now. Hold on. "Older than the old ways." Now this I gotta read. (He piles several books into his arms.)
(Polly is looking at a shelf labeled "Weapons".)
Polly: Hot mama.
Anne(looking at a book diagram of a carnivorous plant): Ew.
Sprig: Hi, Anne. What ya doing?
Anne: Get out of here, man.
Sprig: Oh, come on. Anne.
Anne: Yeah, Sprig?
Sprig: Wouldn't it be better if we found some plants to fight?
Anne: Nope. Here, see if you can find a way to survive a tiger viper attack.
Sprig: (groans) Stupid books. Stupid learning. Don't they want a real adventure?
(gears clink)
Sprig: Hmm.
Polly(reading a book entitled "Daggers and Where To Put Them"): Yes!
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Time for a lunch break.
Anne: I'm actually glad you suggested this, Hop Pop. I'm learning a ton about your terrifying world.
Polly: Did you guys know that there are 60 weapons in the Morningstar family?
Hop Pop: (gasps) The door is shut. That's not right. (grunts) Hmm. (gasps) The lens is missing!
Anne: What? Who would trap us in here?
Sprig: (clears throat) Maybe somebody is trying to prepare us by forcing us to dive in. Me! I did it.
Anne: Dude, have you lost your frog marbles? Put that piece back!
Sprig: Guys, reading these moldy, old books ain't gonna prepare us for squat. What we need is a daring escape from an old, underground library!
Hop Pop: What we need is you putting that piece back.
Polly: Yeah. Hand it over.
Sprig: (sighs) Fine. Party poopers. Uh, mmm. I know I have it, somewhere. (He accidentaly steps on the lens and it shatters.)
Polly: Well, that's not good.
Anne: (groans) Sprig!
Sprig: Uh, maybe I can fix it. Aha! Good as new! (He sneezes and the pieces fly everywhere.)
Anne: Dude!
Polly: Ah, come on!
Anne: Seriously?
Hop Pop: All of you, stop! Yelling at each other ain't fixing any of this.
Anne: So, what do we do?
Hop Pop: Well, we wait for someone to visit the archives.
Anne: Oh, okay. Well, when was the last time someone came down here?
Hop Pop: Well, I checked the logs, and it says... three years ago.
(bangs on door)
Anne and Polly: Help! Get us out of here! Help! Get us out of here! Help! Help! (panting)
Sprig: Enough of this negativity! (grunts) Come on, guys. This is our call to frog-venture right here. Did you forget who we are? This gang has been through a lot. And we're gonna make it through this too! I mean, we better. 'Cause if we don't, we'll be trapped here for weeks. No food, no water. Until they find our dehydrated, mummified bodies clawing at the door.
(Anne, Polly and Hop Pop cringe.)
Sprig: Yeah, I probably could have ended that speech earlier.
Anne: Let's just find a way out.
Sprig: That's the spirit!
(They try to ram the door with a mushroom lamp; it bounces off.)
All: (yells and groans)
(They try digging into the floor and find huge worms, which grab them.)
(creature roars)
All: (yells)
Hop Pop(trying to use his glasses to replace the lens): Hey, I should have thought of this sooner.
(The ground lights on fire.)
All: (gasps) (yells)
Hop Pop: Holy smokes!
(yells)
Hop Pop: (coughs)
Sprig: So...Not good.
Polly: (yells) Why did they have to put the door on a stupid sunlight timer?
Anne: (gasps) That's it! Light timer. Timer, sunlight, light, skylight! I bet we can get out through the skylight!
Sprig: Yeah! That's a great idea, Anne. Ha! (grunts)
(The Plantars have built a huge pile of books, which Anne has climbed on top of to reach the skylight.)
(tower creaks)
Anne: (groans, grunts, sighs)
Sprig: You're almost there!
Polly: Don't fall! I won't catch you!
Anne: It's totally okay. You're a baby! (grunts repeatedly) Almost got it! (struggles) Yes! (laughs, groans) Oh, yeah. No. Definitely can't fit through, though. Hey, I see Bessie. Bessie! Bessie, hey girl!
Bessie: (grunts)
Anne: Bessie, get help! Get help! Come on, girl!
Bessie: (grunts)
Anne: No! No. No, Bessie. Get-- No! Oh, come on. Never mind. Good news, guys. I can see the road from here. One of you can go for help!
All: (cheers)
Polly: All right!
Sprig: See guys? How do you feel about diving in now?
Hop Pop: Now, I suppose, if I'm honest, I do feel somewhat of a rush.
Polly: We can do anything!
Anne: Um, guys? (struggles) I'm stuck!
Sprig: What? (grunts)
Anne: (struggles) I'm seriously stuck! (struggles) Do something!
Sprig: I got this! (struggles) Whoa!
Polly: Whoa! Abandon ship!
Hop Pop: Whoa!
Anne: Uh, what just happened?
Sprig: Uh, nothing. Everything's fine.
Anne: Sprig!
Sprig: Okay, the books fell, and you're stuck and blocking our only way out.
Anne: What?
Sprig: Don't worry. We'll rebuild the tower of books and get you down.
(cicadas buzz)
Anne: What's that sound?
Sprig: Uh, it's cicadas coming out to graze. Which is totally fine. If you just stay super quiet, they should go away.
Anne: Oh, cicadas, like little cute cicadas? Or like-- Oh, my God! That's huge! (yells) No!
(cicadas continue buzzing)
Anne: (yells)
Sprig: Too late.
Anne: I'm not food! I'm not food! I'm not food! Get me the heck out of here!
Hop Pop: Hang in there, Anne!
Anne: (groans) I can't believe this. I tried to do things the right way! And now I'm gonna die stuck in this stupid hole and I'll never get back home!
Sprig: (gasps) That's it! This building used to be someone's home, which means, there was a bathroom!
Hop Pop: Ah, good thinking, Sprig.
Anne: Bathroom? Now? Can't you just hold it? (blows raspberry) (yells)
Polly: There was a bathroom. That also means there were--
Sprig: Pipes! Aha! Here it is! The blueprints!
Hop Pop: And look here. This is where the bathroom used to be, behind that bookcase. We just need to break it down!
Polly: (grunts) War cry!
Sprig: Yes! Don't worry, Anne! I'm on my way!
Anne: Sprig! Hurry up and help me!
(In Felicia's Tea Shoppe, Felicia goes to use the restroom.)
(light, gentle music plays)
(toilet flushes)
(Sprig comes up the toilet.)
Felicia: (screams)
Sprig: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Anne: (screams, grunts)
Sprig: Yahoo!
Anne: Sprig? Wait. How did you get out?
Sprig: I don't wanna talk about it. Yeah!
Cicada: (neighs)
(sound of pins falling)
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! See you later, cicadas! (blows raspberry)
Anne: Thanks, Sprig. That was a close one.
Sprig: I'm just glad you're okay.
Polly: Yeah, so am I.
Hop Pop: Me too.
Polly: We couldn't wait. So we took the pipes too.
Hop Pop: I seen things.
Sprig: So we did it! We dove into another adventure and escaped! I told you it would work.
(Everyone glares at him.)
Anne: We didn't dive in. You pushed us.
Sprig: Yeah, but--
Anne: No, Sprig. Listen. This trip out of the valley, it's more than just another adventure. It's my chance to get home. I can't mess this up. So if that means doing a few things I don't like to help me get ready, well, then...
Sprig: Then that's what we'll do, together.
Anne: (chuckles) Aw. Thanks, buddy.
(The ground caves in under Anne and Sprig, and they fall into the archives.)
Anne and Sprig: (yell, grunt repeatedly)
Anne: We're okay! We landed on books!
Sprig: Knowledge hurts.
(It isn't long before Anne has collected everyone and places them all in the town square.)
Anne: Welp, that's everyone. Heh, that was surprisingly easy. (She proceeds to dab.) Town protector. Yea-yuh! And now all I have to do is watch 'em. (She sits down leaning on a frozen frog only for it to slide away. She yells and goes after it.)
(vocalizing)
Okay, I'm bored. And a bored protector is a bad protector. So I'm gonna need to thaw someone out. Let's see. Eeny, meeny, miney, Sprig.
Phew! This is harder than I thought. Thaw already, Sprig.
(sighs)
Whoa!
Where am I? What's goin' on?
Sprig! Boy, am I glad to see you, buddy. Uh... You okay, dude?
I's awake, yes?
Yeah. Let's thaw out the others. (groans)
Uh... I'm thinking we should let nature run its course. You frogs don't seem to do well in the cold.
Why you say that? Water angels.
Well...
Since you're already awake anyways, let's go have some fun. We've got the whole town to ourselves.
Let's do it!
Hey, Sprig. Catch.
Meh. Caught it.
-Eh. -Eh.
Oh, Mrs. Croaker, I never noticed how marry-able you are.
You too, Wally.
Come in for some kisses.
(kissing)
-(giggles) -(kissing)
(giggles) They're kissing.
Whoo-hoo!
(both laughing)
Look at it, Sprig. It's beautiful. No, no! Don't hurt Mommy.
-(groans) -(giggling)
(giggling)
Anne: All right, enough. We had our fun. But it's time for a little (dabs again) protector duty. (She pulls out a clipboard.) Let's do a head count, make sure everyone is still here.
Sprig: You got it. Am I still here?
We got Tom, Soggy Joe, Jill, Cashmere the Soft.
Hop Pop, check. Polly, check.
Ivy-- Polly?
Polly? No! No, no, no, no, no.
She's gone! What kind of protector am I?
Is something wrong with Polly?
Yes, Sprig. She's gone.
(sighs) This is all my fault. We've got to get her back.
All right!
Is something wrong with Polly?
Wow. Never tracked anything in snow before.
It's hard.
(grunting)
Hey! Who wants a nap?
(snoring)
(grunts)
Just hang on, Sprig. You can go back to hibernating
as soon as we find Polly.
Polly...
(sniffing)
I smell a Polly.
Polly's in that creepy cave.
Of course she is.
You know, no matter how long I'm in this world,
I'll never get used to the piles of bones just lying around.
Hey. That icicle looks just like Polly.
Ah! Polly!
How'd she get up there?
Is she magic?
(rumbling)
What was that?
Whoa!
-(roars) -(screams)
(screeches)
Maybe we can ask this lady. Excuse me, miss--
(grunting)
That's what's been taking the frogs?
I'll keep it busy. You go get Polly.
-(gasps) -Uh, okay.
(grunts)
Wait. Did you mean me?
Mm-hmm.
(snarls)
Polly! Stop dancing around so much. I'm trying to save you.
Hey! Sprig, look out!
Wow. Pointy.
Hey, you big furry freak! Get back here.
-(squeaking) -Huh?
What the...
(chittering)
(snarls)
-Huh? (yells) -(snarls)
No way.
(growling)
You didn't kidnap Polly just to feed yourself?
And if we take her, you'll all starve.
Unless...
Ah, perfect. Maybe just a little more.
-(growling) -Come on, come on. Please work.
(sniffing)
(purrs)
Huh. I guess the power of omelettes is universal.
(panting)
(screams)
(giggles)
(squeaking)
Now that's a protector.
Mm-hmm.
My face feels squishy.
Man, I really shouldn't have thawed you out.
Whoo-hoo!
(both) Five, four, three, two, one.
(Sprig) And thaw, baby, thaw!
-Huh? -Huh? Yee-haw!
-Oh, thank goodness. -We're all here.
We made it through the freeze.
Yay! I'm alive!
Three cheers for Anne, the best town protector there is.
(all) Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
Hold it.
(sighs)
I was a terrible town protector, you guys.
I slacked off when I should've been watching you.
I unfroze Sprig when I got bored.
I'm fine.
And worst of all, Polly almost got eaten by a giant weasel.
Say what?
I'm no town protector.
I'm just an irresponsible kid.
Anne, you admitting that means you're more responsible than you think.
Really?
Yeah, if you hadn't fessed up,
we never would have known anything happened.
-Oh, yeah, it's true. -That's a good point.
You may not be perfect, but you proved that we can depend on you.
And, most importantly, this is the first year no one disappeared.
All because of you.
Happy Hiber Day, everyone.
-Yay, Anne! -Whoo!
-Aw. Thanks, you guys. -Hey, everyone.
Check out these funny photos we took.
Sprig, no!
That's my body.
-(all gasping) -Oh, my...
Did you use our frozen bodies as bowling pins?
Uh...
Felicia: Hi, Sprig. Thanks for your help in the tea shop the other day.
Sprig: No problem, Felicia. I had a tea-rrific time.
Felicia: (chuckles) Oh, come here, you little charmer.
Sprig: (laughing)
Felicia: Oh, look at you. Okay, bye.
Sprig: All right, see ya.
Jerry: Hiya, Sprig.
Sprig: Heya, Jerry.
Patrick: Top of the mornin' to you, Sprig.
Sprig: Lookin' good, Patrick.
Ferraiolo: Buongiorno, Sprig.
Sprig: Hey, all right!
Anne: Wow. People around here really seem to like Sprig.
Polly: Yep, he's always been something of a town favorite.
(Sprig makes a Kawaii-like face.)
Polly: Those big eyes and goofy grin are hard to resist.
(A horn honks and Sprig turns to see Mrs. Croaker on her ladybug approaching.)
Sprig: Hey-hey! Here comes Mrs. Croaker. Hi, Mrs. Croaker!
(Mrs. Croaker zooms right past without saying hi.)
Sprig: Heh. This thing broken?
Anne, Polly: Hi, Mrs. Croaker!
Mrs. Croaker: Well, hello, Anne. Polly.
Polly: (giggling)
Sprig: (panting)
Sprig: Hi, Mrs. Croa...ker...? That was weird. Guys, you aren't gonna believe this, but...I don't think Mrs. Croaker likes me!!
Anne: Huh. So what do you think Hop Pop's making for dinner tonight?
Sprig: How could she not like me? I'm Sprig. The fun Plantar!
Anne: Don't worry about it, dude. It's okay if one person doesn't like you.
Sprig: You know what, Anne, you're right. This is not okay.
Anne: That's literally the opposite of what I just said.
Sprig: Looks like it's time to crank up the charm on this widow.
(He holds the door open for Mrs. Croaker on the way out of the store.)
Sprig: (chuckles) After you, m'lady. What?
Frog: Oh, hey. Thanks so much--
Sprig(trying to grab Mrs. Croaker's groceries from her): Wait. Uh, let me help you with that. (straining) Whoa!
(crash)
Sprig: No, wait! Mrs. Croaker, come back. (sobbing) Acknowledge me!
Polly: That was the saddest thing I've ever seen. And I've seen some things.
Sprig: How can I fix this?
Anne: Totally feel for you, dude. I had the same issue with a girl named Jamie Krieger back home. My advice? Just let it go.
Sprig: You know what, Anne? You're right. I can't just let this go. I have to get Mrs. Croaker to like me. And I can't do that unless I know more about her. Fact-finding mission, engage! Haha!
Anne: Sprig! (sighs)
Polly: Get used to this feeling.
(Sprig starts interviewing townspeople about Mrs. Croaker.)
Stumpy: Croaker? She's just a kooky old spider lady. What's there to know?
Loggle: I think she was born that old. She looked exactly the same when I was a kid.
Maddie: She smells like wet leaves and fungus. I love it.
Mr. Flour(from upstairs): Maddie, the buns are burning!
Maddie: (screams)
(Anne and Polly are still in front of the grocery store. Anne is playing a game on her phone while Polly watches.)
Polly: Come on, Anne. Shake that man. Shake him.
Sprig: (groans) I spent all day and I know even less about her than I did before.
Hop Pop(emerging from the store): Sorry about the wait, kids.
Sprig: Hop Pop! Mrs. Croaker doesn't like me!
Hop Pop: Huh. So, what do you kids want for dinner? I was thinking ravioli.
Anne: Aw, yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about.
Sprig: (sighs)
Sprig(bursting into Anne's room at home): Anne! I've got it.
Anne: (screams)
Sprig: I have a completely reasonable plan for getting Mrs. Croaker to like me.
Anne: Glad to hear it. Lay it on me.
Sprig: Well, I'm going to break into her house, search through her belongings, find the key to her secret wishes, and make them all come true.
Anne: Dude, what? That's completely crazy pants! Listen, Sprig, Mrs. Croaker is just like Jamie Krieger, who, for some inexplicable reason, didn't like me.
Sprig: Anne, this is totally different. This is about me. I'm totally likable. While you can be a bit...
Anne: Go on.
Sprig:...likable. Also.
Anne: Darn right I'm likable. I gave Jamie all my pudding cups at lunch. Even the chocolate ones with the vanilla ribbons. And nothing. What was her problem?
Polly: (looking down from the top of the stairs) Will you two stop yelling? You know there's no soundproofing on these walls, right?
Anne: Wait, seriously?
Sprig: Yep. Don't you hear Hop Pop yodel himself to sleep every night?
Anne: (gasps) I thought it was a stray animal or something.
Polly: Nope, just our Hop Pop bein' a freak.
(banging)
Hop Pop:(from upstairs) You're a freak!
Sprig: Welp, I've got a house to break into, so...
(grunting)
(Sprig hides as Mrs. Croaker is leaving her house. He sneaks inside once she's gone.)
Sprig: All right, Mrs. Croaker. Let's see what you're all about. Huh. Wonder what kind of books she reads.
(He picks up a romance novel entitled "In the Heat of the Swamp" with a frog couple on the front.)
Sprig: That's gonna be hard to forget. (chuckles) Ooh, candy. (He tries taking a piece from a bowl, but it's all stuck together.) Ew, gross. Uh-oh. (The candy sticks to his hand; while trying to get it off he damages her cabinet.)
(shatters)
Sprig(looking at a set of fake teeth): Whoa. Probably shouldn't put these in my mouth. I'm gonna do it. (slurps)
Anne(coming in with Polly): Sprig! Psst! You gotta get outta here, man.
Sprig(holding a bundle of stuff): Oh, hi, guys. Come to help?
Anne: Uh, yeah, you need help, bud. But not with this.
Polly: This is deranged!
Anne: All right, dude, put the stuff back. We're leaving.
Sprig: What? No.
Anne(trying to grab the stuff from him): Come on, Sprig!
(both struggling)
(The stuff flies everywhere and a chest labeled "Secret Memories" opens. Several pictures come out.)
Anne: What the--
Sprig: Hey! Is that Mrs. Croaker?
Anne: Dang, she was hot.
Sprig: Hold on. Who is that? (gasps) Here he is again. Wait a second. Oh, my gosh. Mrs. Croaker has a long-lost love. Jonah this. Jonah that. Even a map of where he might be. There's a frog out there that wants to be with her, and that she wants to be with.
Anne: Hmm. It does kinda seem like she's obsessed with him.
Polly: I guess it's possible.
Sprig: I'm going to hunt down that frog and reunite them. And then, she won't like me. Oh, no. She'll love me.
(manic laughter)
(door closes)
Anne(to Polly): So, you wanna stay here and look at more pictures of hot Croaker?
Polly: You read my mind.
Sprig: Hmm. (gasps) Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, I found it. Okay, Sprig, be cool. Be cool. Come on out, Jonah. Do I have a surprise for you!
Jonah: Eh? Who's there? You from the Puzzle of the Month Club?
Sprig: Nope. I'm here on behalf of Sadie Croaker.
Jonah: Sadie? Sadie Croaker sent you?
Sprig: Well, no. It's a long story, but--
Jonah: This is incredible. I've been searching for Sadie for 30 years!
Sprig: (gasps) I knew it.
Jonah: Now then, can you tell me where she's been all this time?
Sprig: I'll do you one better. I'll take you right to her.
Jonah: Oh, yes! Son, you just made this lonely old frog (inhales) very happy. Mmm.
Sprig: Great. Now let's go.
Jonah: Here I come, Sadie.
Anne: Sprig, where have you been? And who is the strange man attached to you?
Sprig: Ahem, this handsome bachelor happens to be the frog that is going to make Mrs. Croaker like me forever.
Jonah: Name's Jonah.
Sprig: Okay. Let's get this show on the road. Mrs. Croaker! Do I have a surprise for you.
Mrs. Croaker: Ooh! Is it the Puzzle of the Month Club? (gasps) J-- Jonah?
Jonah: Sadie.
Mrs. Croaker: Jonah?
Sprig: (gasps) Oh, my gosh, they're about to flirt. (squeals)
Jonah: It really is you.
Mrs. Croaker: What are you doing here?
Jonah: Sadie Croaker, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for 30 years.
Sprig: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Jonah: Sadie Croaker...prepare to die! (manic laughter)
Sprig: Wait, what?
Jonah: Sadie, Sadie, Sadie. You thought you got the best of me in Bogwater Canyon, but I haven't forgotten.
Sprig: Jonah, this isn't romantic!
Jonah: The Guild would surely take me back if I took you down. Thirty years I been searching for ya, but you hid too well. But now, thanks to this weird little frog leading me straight to you, your time is up.
Sprig: Uh... (nervous laughter)
Mrs. Croaker: You should have let sleeping frogs lie and stayed away. You'd have spared yourself from what's about to happen.
Jonah: Ha! What're you gonna do to me now? You're just an old woman.
Mrs. Croaker: You're old!
Jonah: You're old!
Mrs. Croaker: You're old!
Jonah: You're old!
Sprig: No. He's right. She is just an old woman. I'll save you, Mrs. Croaker.
(grunts)
Mrs. Croaker: Step aside, boy.
(grunts, laughs)
Mrs. Croaker: Bleh! Put your clothes back on, you pervert.
Polly: Whoo! Yeah, Croaker! Mess him up.
(both grunting)
(screaming)
Anne: Whoa. That was--
Polly: Awesome!
Sprig: What just happened?
(muffled groaning)
Mrs. Croaker: Nothing happened. Nothing at all. Because if word of this gets out, let's just say it would be very bad for everyone. Are we clear?
Anne: These lips be zipped.
Polly: Didn't see a thing.
Sprig: Yes, of course. So sorry.
Mrs. Croaker: All right, boy. What's this all about? Spill it.
Sprig: I wanted to get you to like me. So I kind of...snuck into your house and secretly went through all your things. (groans)
Mrs. Croaker: What?
Sprig: And I saw all this stuff about Jonah and I thought he was your long-lost love.
Mrs. Croaker: (laughing)
Sprig, Polly, Anne: (nervous laughter)
Jonah: (muffled laugh)
Mrs. Croaker: What an idiot. What makes you think you can please everyone, kid? Jonah here don't like me.
Jonah: It's true.
Mrs. Croaker(pointing to Anne and Polly): Plenty of people don't like those two.
Anne: Well, hey, now.
Polly: Mission accomplished.
Mrs. Croaker: And I just don't like you.
Sprig: But what did I do? Why don't you like me? I mean, I like you.
Mrs. Croaker: I don't know. Something about your big eyes and goofy smile rub me the wrong way.
Sprig: Oh.
Mrs. Croaker: But you did go through all that trouble to get me to like you. I guess I can try and like you back.
Sprig: Huh. Yeah, no, that's okay. You're right. Like me or don't like me, I'm fine.
Mrs. Croaker: (chuckles) Atta-kid.
Anne: Cool. Well, I guess we'll get going then.
Sprig: She likes me! Aw, yeah! Wa-pow! Good thing I brought this. (Pulls out a hat emblazoned with the words "She Likes Me".) She likes me. She likes me.
Anne(to Mrs. Croaker): You walked right into that one.
Polly: Good luck getting rid of him now.
Sprig: I'm likable. I'm lovable.
Mrs. Croaker: Aw, crud.
Sprig: She likes me!
(Anne and the Plantars are looking at the mountain pass out of the valley, which is blocked with a giant wall of ice.)
Hop Pop: Well, Anne, I don't wanna say I told you so.
Anne: Yes, you do.
Hop Pop: Okay, you're right. I told you so. (chuckles) Still gonna be a few weeks before that snowpack melts.
Anne: (groans) But I've waited so long. And getting out of this valley might help me find answers on how to get home.
Sprig: I know it stinks, but how about some careless misadventuring to take your mind off it? I think there's a creepy lagoon nearby.
Anne: Ooh! Think we'll find some bloated remains?
Sprig: Here's hoping.
(Both giggle and run off.)
Polly: And while they're doing that, I'm gonna check out this scary forest.
Hop Pop: Oh, no, you don't. Not by yourself.
Polly: (groans) But why not?
Hop Pop: 'Cause you're a pollywog. You're too young to go off on your own.
Polly: But the other kids did.
(creature screeching)
Anne and Sprig(reappearing suddenly): Go, go, go, go!
(Everyone jumps onto the wagon.)
Hop Pop: Hyah!
Anne: Whew! Who knew leeches could run so fast?
Sprig: Or had legs?
Anne: Glad I got to see them, though.
Sprig: Truly a once in a lifetime experience.
Polly: (moans)
Bessie: (sputters)
All: (gasp)
(sputters)
Hop Pop: Oh, shoot. Snail trouble, everyone. Snail trouble.
Sprig: Hmm. Stranded, eh? Well, couldn't have picked a nicer day.
(It immediatly starts raining. Everyone glares at Sprig.)
Hop Pop: Whoa. Dang it. It's too darn muddy for me to squeeze under Bessie to see what's the trouble.
Polly: Hey, I can fit under Bessie.
Hop Pop: No, you stay up there where it's safe.
Polly: (huffs)
Anne: Hey, look. There's a bed and breakfast just down the road.
Hop Pop: Forget it. We ain't spending coppers on lodging when we've got a perfectly fine tent--
(wind blows)
(The tent blows away and gets destroyed by a thunderclap.)
Hop Pop: All right, B&B it is. But no extras. Hang tight, Bessie. We'll find you a comfy place to rest in a jiffy.
Bessie: (purrs)
(They run to the inn and go inside.)
Hop Pop: Wow.
All: (gasp)
Sprig: Look at this place. So cozy.
(bell dings)
Teddy: Oh, hey there. Welcome to the Dandy Lion B&B. I'm Teddy. This is my wife, Martha.
Martha: Please, warm yourselves by the fire.
Hop Pop: Oh, well, that sounds nice.
Anne: Yes, please. Wow, haven't come across a species like you before.
Martha: Same to you, dearie. We're horned bullfrogs.
Hop Pop: Oh, so not from around these parts?
Teddy: Yeah, we traveled here a long time ago and just, you know, (chuckles) fell in love with the area. Isn't that right, sweetie?
Martha: Oh, we sure did.
Teddy: So, I take it you'll be needing some rooms?
Hop Pop: Just one, please. We'll all pile in.
Teddy: Oh, no need. We only have a couple of guests tonight, so the inn is mostly empty.
Martha: We'll make you a deal. Four rooms for the price of one. What do you say?
(all cheering)
Sprig: Heck yeah!
Polly: Score!
Hop Pop: Thanks. But we only need three. Polly here'll be bunking with me.
Polly: What? Aw, Hop Pop!
Martha: Here's some fresh cookies.
Sprig: Mmm!
Teddy: And we'll go put your snail in the barn.
Hop Pop: Thank you.
Anne: Hey! Watch it.
Sprig: Mine!
Hop Pop: Get your hands off my cookies.
Polly: (groans)
(Hop Pop carries Polly to their room. They pass Anne and Sprig in their own rooms on the way there.)
Hop Pop: (yawns)
(music playing on stereo)
Anne: Whoo! Happiness, thy name is solitude.
Sprig: Freedom! And check it out. A laundry chute! (laughing)
Polly: This is so not fair. I want my own room!
Hop Pop: Sorry, kiddo. But you're just too young for that. But you can have as many cookies as you want.
Polly: I don't want your pity cookies.
Hop Pop: No? Well, then how about a pity early bedtime?
Polly: But I'm not tired.
Hop Pop: Yep, but I am. One room, one bedtime. Lights out in five minutes.
Polly: (sighs) (gasps) Hop Pop, look. There's another room connected to this one. Can I stay in here?
Hop Pop: Well...
Polly: I'll leave the door open. And I'll go straight to bed. Pretty, pretty please?
Hop Pop: (groans) Okay, fine.
Polly: Whoo! Yeah! Thanks, Hop Pop. You're the best.
Hop Pop: But this door stays open. And no jumping about. Straight to bed.
Polly: Absolutely.
Hop Pop: Now, I'm right here if you need me.
Polly: Got it. Three, two, one.
(Hop Pop falls onto his bed snoring. Polly slams the door.)
Polly: Finally! Independence. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (laughs) Whoo! Yeah! (chuckles) Hyah! (sighs) Time to snuggle up in my own bed. (She turns off the light.)
(creaking)
Polly: What's that?
(thunderclap)
(gasps)
Polly: Okay, it's a little creepy, but nothing I can't handle--(squeaks)
(In the corner, a giant skeleton looks at Polly. She screams and turns the light on, and the skeleton turns out to be an assortment of random items.)
Polly: (laughs nervously) All right, just a bowling ball, a mop, and other assorted items oddly arranged in the corner.
(creaking)
Polly: You know, I'm not really tired. I should go see what Anne and Sprig are up to.
(She bursts into Anne's room.)
Polly: Hey, girlfriend! Huh, not here. Weird. Anne doesn't go anywhere without her phone. Well, let's go see what Sprig is up to.
(She goes into Sprig's room.)
Polly: Hey-o! Where's the party at? Huh. Sprig's not here either. It's fine. Totally fine. They're probably just somewhere else. And now to calmly head back to my own room.
(She pants as she gets to her room as fast as she can, then looks at the door connecting her room to Hop Pop's.)
Polly: (grunts) No, Polly. Resist. You go crawling back to Hop Pop now and you'll never be left on your own again. It'll be fine. You'll be fine.
(creaking)
(owl hoots)
Polly: Hop Pop! I don't wanna be on my own. Sprig and Anne are missing and I'm scared. I don't wanna--
(door creaks)
Martha: (evil laughter) I've been looking all over for you.
Polly: (screams)
Martha: Ha! Huh? (laughs)
(roars)
(panting)
(whimpers)
(creaking)
Martha: Huh? (roars)
Polly: (yells)
(screams)
(grunting)
(groaning)
(Polly jumps down the laundry chute. At the bottom, she sees Teddy and two other bullfrogs through the grate with four cards in front of them.)
Teddy: All right, time to pick a card. Juliet, I think you went first last time, so, Juniper, you go first.
Juniper: Ooh. Looks like I've got the geezer. Aged to perfection. Juliet?
Juliet: I got the tall one. Talk about your drumsticks.
Teddy: Well, I guess I'll just have to be happy with the boy. Cook time will be much shorter. Delicious.
Polly: (gasps) They're cannibals.
Martha(coming in): Ooh. The little one got away. Must not have eaten any of my cookies. Were they not sweet enough? Did I goof the recipe? Oh, dearie me.
Teddy: Oh, come on, Martha. No one makes a slumberdoodle better than you, and you know that.
Juniper: All right, you love birds, that's enough.
Juliet: Yeah, we're hungry.
(They tie Anne, Sprig and Hop Pop to a stick and start rotating them over the fire. All three are unconcious.)
Juniper: Mmm, delectable.
Hop Pop: (snores)
Polly: That's my family!
Teddy: Well, let me just go get the marinade ready and--
Polly: Hyah! Marinate this, you cannibals!
Teddy: Ah!
Polly: Hyah!
(grunting)
Polly: Rise and shine, fam. (She smacks each of them.)
Hop Pop: Huh? Wha-- What's goin' on?
Anne: (grunts) Five more minutes.
Sprig: Hi, Polly.
Polly: Hey. We gotta get out of here.
Martha: Oh, dear. You're in way over your head, sweetie.
Teddy: Yeah, what can a legless little tadpole like you do to stop us?
(cackling)
Polly: You're right. I am just a little tadpole, and I'm not ready to be alone!
Teddy: My marinade!
(all gasp, groan)
Polly: All right, time to get a move on, fam. (grunts)
Teddy: Now, just hold on a second--
Hop Pop: This way. Let's move.
Teddy: Don't you dare leave. (groans)
Anne(looking at two barrels with baking soda and vinegar): Finally. A chance to use everything I know about chemistry.
(knuckles crack)
Hop Pop: We gotta find Bessie.
All: Bessie!
Bessie: (purrs)
Sprig: Oh, thank goodness you're all right, you beautiful, precious princess.
Hop Pop: Sprig, bring that lantern over here. Polly, get under there and take a look.
Polly: You got it, chief.
(grunts)
Hop Pop: A trap. So that's what slowed her down.
(grunts)
(chirps)
Hop Pop: How the heck did this get on her tail, though?
Sprig: Uh... Hop Pop?
(Sprig looks around at the rest of the stables, where dozens of snails with traps are looking at him.)
(all purring, chirping)
(whines)
Sprig: This was all a setup. They trap passengers at the inn. We're the "breakfast" in "bed and breakfast."
Hop Pop: Yeah, obvi. Let's go.
Anne: (laughing)
Hop Pop: What are you laughing about?
Anne: Nothing. Let's get outta here.
Hop Pop: Bessie, things are gettin' messy.
Bessie: (chirps)
(all yell)
(Bessie rushes out of the stable, followed by the other captive snails.)
Teddy: Ooh, thanks honey. Hey, do you hear that? Did you leave the sink running?
(He looks around. The two barrels are tipped over and leaking into each other.)
Teddy: Oh, dear.
(The inn blows up.)
Bessie: (chirps)
Anne: Chemistry wins! Yes!
Sprig: Home sweet home.
Anne: (sighs)
Hop Pop: You know, Polly, even though you're still a tadpole, you certainly proved you can be on your own. Maybe it's time I give you a little more independence.
Polly: Thanks, Hop Pop. But I was actually hoping to sleep in your room tonight. Being on my own was kinda freaky.
Hop Pop: I suppose that'd be all right.
(bedroom door opens)
Anne: So. Turns out tonight's events were a tad traumatic.
Sprig: Room for two more?
Polly: Get in here, you crazy kids.
(Anne and Sprig sigh)
Hop Pop: Great grubs, Sprig! Your feet are cold!
Sprig: Deal with it.
Polly: (giggles)
We've finally made it. The Misty Moors.
Time for the Moss Man summoning ritual.
Summoning ritual?
(chanting gibberish)
Uh... Are you sure this is gonna work?
(gasps) Butterflies!
Oi! Where are you going? I'm only halfway done.
(panting)
(gasps)
Oh.
Whoa.
Hmm?
(groans)
(low growling)
(gasping)
(screaming)
-Quick! After it. -Oh, right.
(panting) Wait!
No! Wait.
No.
(panting)
(panting) Where'd it go?
Oh, dang mist!
We lost him again.
We were so close.
I just can't believe it's actually real.
I know, right? Wait, what?
I thought it was a myth. I mean, it's preposterous.
But you-- I don't-- What?
So you took me all the way out here based on a lie?
Yeah. I mean, we had fun, though, didn't we?
That's not the point. I could've easily gone back with no proof.
And then everyone would think I was like you.
What's so bad about being like me?
Wally...
Oh, woof.
Wally. I didn't-- (sighs)
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
It's cool you don't care what people think about you.
And I'm glad we came out here together.
-You mean it? -Totally.
Clap it, pull it back, fist bump...
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, no. Maybe... -Um...
-Yeah? Is that right? -It was... something like that? Yeah?
Now let's get a pic of that Moss Man. Together.
Oh! Look!
Huh? (yells) There it goes.
We gotta hoof it.
(both panting)
(Wally) Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
Huh?
(low purr)
Good thing I did bouldering club in school.
(grunting)
One hand in front of the other, Wally.
(grunts)
Oh! My iconic hat.
(grunts, gasps)
(low growling)
(chuckles) Perfect.
Yo, Wally, you almost up here?
Yep. And I think I'm really starting
-to get the hang of this. -(cracking)
(yells)
-Wally! -(screams)
(grunting)
Wally! Hold on, I'm coming.
No. I'll be fine. Just take the picture!
(growling)
(yelling)
(grunts)
I got you, buddy.
Thanks. Did you get the picture?
Not yet. Come on.
One, two, three.
(screams)
Upsy-daisy.
(sighs) It's gone.
The trail's gone too.
You lost your one chance to get proof
and it's all my fault.
Now everyone's gonna think you're as loony as I am.
You know what? I'm good with that.
Wait, really? What a turnaround.
We know what we saw.
And a good friend once told me
it doesn't matter what other people think of you.
That's a good line. Would your friend mind if I used it?
It was you, Wally.
(cackles) Yeah, I know.
Or was it?
You goofball.
-(screaming) -Wally!
So there we were, our bodies ravaged.
Hanging on the edge of the cliff,
the beastie staring down at us, lickin' its mossy chops.
Any proof?
Absolutely not.
-(all murmuring) -They're two peas in a pod, these loons.
-Eh, tough crowd. -Can't please everyone.
Well, best be heading off.
 Oh, there once was a lass Named Anne the Fair 
 She put up a front And played her part 
 But soon enough Touched this loon's heart 
Anne! We heard people at Stumpy's saying you're as weird as Wally.
You must be pretty upset.
(scoffs) Honestly, guys, I don't mind.
You don't have to be strong for us.
Let it out, girl.
No, seriously. I'm fine.
Shh. Poor thing.
(yells)
I'm One-Shoed Anne!
(Polly) She's deranged!
Sprig: Ah, the annual Plantar fishing trip. I can't wait to cast off.
Anne: Me either, my froggy friend. But I'm not fishing. I'm parasailing, baby!
Polly: Wow! Flying? What a great way to spy on my enemies. (evil laugh)
Anne: What do you say, Sprig? Why fish when you can fly?
Sprig: Ooh, tempting. But, nope. I'd rather fish. It's what Hop Pop and I have done on this trip ever since I was a pollywog. (gasps) First we'd get the bait ready.
(grunting)
(screams)
Sprig: Then he'd let me steer the boat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sprig: Then we'd spend the rest of the day fishing together. We look forward to this all year. It's our special time, and that's never gonna change.
Sylvia: Hello, children. I'm so glad I get to join you all on this boat trip.
Oh, hey, Sylvia.
You're coming, too? Cool!
Oh. Hey, Sylvia.
Has anyone seen Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Morning, kids. Ready for the brisk open waters? Ahoy, there.
Anne: Dang, HP. Looking good.
Sylvia: Isn't he dreamy?
Oh, hey. Well-- (giggling)
Now come on, my dear. I'll show you around the boat.
Oh, how lovely!
Sprig: What the heck? He can't fish in that ridiculous outfit.
Anne: Looks like Hop Pop's fishing for something else.
Polly: Ew. Gross, Anne.
Sprig: (blows raspberry) This doesn't change a thing. He and I are still gonna spend the day together and have our special time.
-Anchors away, and here we go! -(Sylvia) Whoo!
(Anne) Boat trip! Yeah!
(Sprig) Let's do it!
Eh, we'll fix it when we get back.
To the sea!
(clatters)
You let go.
No, you let go.
No, you.
No, you.
(giggling)
Parasailing is easy. The wind does all the work.
Where did you learn all this again?
Hours and hours of extensive research.
Sweet. Mom! Can I try parasailing?
(mom speaking Thai) Mi tae khun samarth phabpha di hak txngkar. (No, but you can fold your laundry if you want.)
Ugh. Never mind! I'm sure he's fine.
Whoo! Time to prove my mom wrong-- Ah!
(Anne screaming)
Looking good, Anne. (laughs)
(groaning)
Um, don't you and Hop Pop usually do that together?
He said to start without him. Ouch.
Hey. This doesn't mean anything. Hop Pop and I are still gonna--
Wait, they're fishing together?
Now, follow through on your-- Oh! You're a natural.
Well, I have a great teacher.
Oh! (both giggle)
Whoa! (crash)
(groans)
I can't believe this. He's ditching me?
(Anne screaming, grunts)
I really think I'm getting the hang of this.
Anne, you're not going to believe this. Hop Pop is--
I know, dude. I saw the whole thing from up top.
Bummer. But what can you do, right?
It's not like you can make Sylvia go awa-- (screams)
Over here, Sylvia!
I wanna show you this thing Sprig and I used to do that's super fun.
(grunts)
Hey! I know that look.
You're going to sabotage this fishing trip so that Sylvia leaves, aren't you?
What? No! What do I look like, some petty child to you?
Yes. (yells)
Chum bomb! (groans)
(evil laugh)
(giggling)
(evil laugh)
Oh!
Ah!
Whoa!
Ooh!
(gasps)
Oh!
(groans)
(sighs)
 A little baby frog like me 
 Thought of only possibility 
 Of hanging with my Hop 
 Of hanging with my Pop 
 But now what once was two Is three 
 And it's looking pretty dark To me 
 This baby baby frog is sad 
(sighs)
(Anne screaming)
(grunts)
Hey, Anne.
You almost had that one!
Really? No.
Whoo! Gonna get back out there.
Dude, you have to shake off this whole Hop Pop thing
and just have fun.
We're on a boat-- (screams)
Sprig, Anne is right.
Maybe it's time to let this one go.
You know, be the-- (inhales) bigger frog (exhales) and all that.
Excuse me? You mean just-- Whoa.
Give up my special time with Hop Pop?
Why not? Crazier things have happened.
Like that.
No! Stinkbugs!
Bleh! (screams) Uh-oh!
(groans)
Whoa!
Sprig? Can we talk? Uh!
Sylvia, great to see you. Why, of course we can talk. I love to talk. Let's talk.
You're a tense little boy.
Come on.
And now, back to our show. (giggles)
(thumping) (Anne) Ah! No! Not in the mouth!
Sprig, is there something bothering you?
(laughs) What? Me? No. Never. Who? How?
Mmm-hmm. Well, I just want you to know
I'm having an amazing time with you and your family today.
I mean, just feel that breeze! See the sights!
Just look at that island over there.
Ain't those just the prettiest blossoms you've ever seen?
(muffled evil laughter)
Funny thing, Sylvia.
Those are Hop Pop's favorite flowers.
No kidding?
Oh, he loves them.
In fact, he'd really appreciate it
if you swam over there and picked him a couple as a surprise.
Why, Sprig, that is a fine idea.
Not to brag, but I'm quite the swimmer.
I'll be back in about 15 minutes. Tops.
(muttering) Yeah, we'll see about that.
Thanks again, Sprig.
(evil laughter) Wait.
This is going too far.
 This baby baby frog is sad 
(singsong) Oh, Hop Pop!
We don't have much time.
-Let's-- -(Hop Pop) Oh, there you are, boy.
Sylvia thought you might want fishing time with me.
She... She did?
Yep. She said she could tell something was bugging you
and suggested I spend some quality time with you.
So, here I am.
Sylvia's... a pretty cool lady.
You're lucky to have her.
Oh, I thank Frog for her every day.
Hop Pop, not related to anything, but, uh,
can we turn this boat around, please?
(Sylvia screams)
That's Sylvia! She's in trouble!
What's she doing off the boat? I'll explain later.
We heard Sylvia scream. Is everything okay?
She's back there.
(Anne) Where? I can't see her.
If only we had a bird's-eye view.
Step aside.
Sprig, it's not as easy as it looks.
How is he doing that?
I see her. Over there.
(screams)
Whoa!
(whimpers)
I'm coming, Syl.
(groaning, screaming)
This crab is making me very scared!
But also very hungry.
(gasps)
Hang on, Sylvia.
(grunts)
Put the boat in reverse. Put the boat in reverse.
Aye-aye, Sprig.
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Get back to the briny depths of filth where you belong, you son of a sea slug!
Wow, HP. That's a lot of woman.
(chuckles) Don't I know it.
Oh, Sylvia! You're safe.
Sure am, and that's not all.
Got your favorite flowers.
Um, my favorite flowers are daffodils.
Everybody knows that.
(chuckles) They funny.
(sighs)
Sylvia, I have a confession to make.
The reason you were on that island and almost became a crab snack
is because I'm a selfish, petty child
who wanted his Hop Pop all to himself.
Oh, now he admits it.
You're a cool lady. And Hop Pop's lucky to have you.
We all are.
Well, thank you, Sprig.
I know sharing a man like Hoppy is difficult.
After all, he's such a catch.
(babbles)
Now what do you say we cut the chatter and get fishing?
Together. Yeah!
Whoo! Yes!
 And this baby baby frog 
 Is glad  (shouts)
Chum bomb, you little weenie!
Polly out!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
So, does anyone else wanna go back for that crab, though?
I mean, yowza. That thing probably had a ton of meat, right?
Anyone?
Don't leave me hanging here, people.
Hop Pop: Well, that was a waste of time.
Anne: Ugh, you said it. Can't believe there was nothing in the archives about my music box.
Sprig & Polly: (Looking at the music box) Wow.
Sprig: So, you really think this is your key to getting home?
Anne: Well, it zapped me here, so, yeah. It's pretty much my only lead. (opens the music box) Really looking forward to finding someone who can help me fix this thing.
Bleh!
Don't worry, Anne. We'll figure it out eventually.
(Bessie screeching) Whoa!
Hey, get outta the way, you... Whatever the heck you are.
Hmm.
Oh, hey. What's that?
Man, these things are cute.
(chirping) Aw.
Sprig! Sprig! Hmm?
(Anne) Don't put your hand in there.
Sprig: Whoa! Guys, look what I found! I think it's an entry ticket for the Bizarre Bazaar!
Anne: The what now?
Sprig: The Bizarre Bazaar. I've never been, but I've heard stories. It's a mysterious night market that passes through once a year. Exotic foods, games, mysterious treasures.
Anne: Really? Maybe someone there will know how my music box works.
Hop Pop: Hold up! From what I've heard, that bazaar is full of greedy degenerates. Wave that thing around, and it'll get stolen for sure. Tell you what. I'll reach out to some frogs I knoW and see if they know a thing about your music chest.
Anne: Box.
Hop Pop: That, too.
Anne: (sighs) All right, fine.
Hop Pop: Finally. Let's go. Hyah! Hyah!
Sprig: We're going to the Bizarre Bazaar tonight, aren't we?
Anne: Obvi.
(snoring)
(snickering)
Anne: Yeah-uh! Bizarre Bazaar, here we come. (puts the music box in her backpack) Okay, which way?
Sprig: I don't know. I think the egg is supposed to show us. (drops the egg) Whoops.
Anne: Dude!
(gasps) After it!
(panting)
It got away.
(gasps) There it goes!
No! We were so close.
(gasps) Huh?
(gasps)
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.
(music playing)
Skins and pelts, skins and pelts.
(buzzing)
(squeals)
Whoa. Wow.
Hop Pop was right. This place is intense.
Hey, watch it, string bean. Oh, sorry.
Hey, look!
Check it out. Those look like the markings on my music box.
Suspiciously so.
Where's the vendor?
(groans) Are you kidding me? (sighs)
Hey, hey. It's fine. They'll be back.
And in the meantime,
might as well check out the rest of the bazaar.
(laughing) Okay.
But we gotta come right back here.
I don't wanna mess this up.
Two, please.
(sizzling) Ooh! Hot, hot.
Here you go, Anne.
Hey, this actually looks pretty good.
Ugh! Or not.
(chirping)
Ooh!
Yes! I win! Now I can buy my house back. Hooray!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(slurps) Ah!
Whoa!
Wow. It's amazing how far removed this place is from Wartwood.
There's absolutely nothing familiar here.
Oh, hey, there's Wally.
Come on. Wally needs a new pair of shoes.
Whoo-hoo!
What? This is larceny! I want my money back!
(gasps) You know the rules.
No refunds at the Bizarre Bazaar.
You're coming with us.
Ah! Get your hands off me. Help!
-Hmm. Hmm. -(Sprig) Mmm, mmm.
(munching) Mmm.
(gasps) Finally!
(groans)
(Romanian accent) Now where did I put my incense burner?
Huh?
Ah, velcome. Velcome to Valeriana's Antiques.
(murmuring) Anne, I think she's missing an arm.
I heard that. Oh! (laughs) Hey. What is this thing?
Just one of my many treasures collected from my years of travel.
(both) Whoa!
I've seen and heard it all.
(squawks) Seen it all. Heard it all.
Betcha haven't seen anything like me, though.
No, not exactly.
Uh, there's something I'd like you to take a look at.
Uh, you sure about this? Maybe Hop Pop was right.
You heard her. She's seen it all.
If anyone knows anything about the music box--
My backpack! Where'd it go?
(cackles)
Hey! That's my backpack, you little creep.
Get back here!
Valeriana: Could it be, Leander? Could she be the one we've been searching for?
(squawks, coughs)
No, Leander! Not on the carpet.
Stop that tiny thief! (panting)
(panting)
Marnie: (gulps) Greetings. Come to try your luck at my fun and exciting game?
Anne: Absolutely not! Give me my backpack!
Marnie: Backpack?
Anne: The one on your prize wall!
Marnie: Oh, you mean the magical pouch of mystery. Who can say where it came from? Or how?
Anne: Nice try.
Ha!
(grunts) What?
Marnie: Ah-ah-ah! Once something is on the prize wall, the only way to get it back is to win it. Sorry, hon, Bizarre Bazaar rules.
Anne: The music box. I can't lose it.
(gasps) What are we gonna do?
Looks like there's only one thing we can do.
All right, we'll play your game, you little sicko.
So what is it? Dunk tank? Whack-a-mole?
Whack-a-tank-a-dunk-a-mole?
(chuckles) Oh, it's a little more involved than that.
Behold!
That's right, folks. Thrills! Chills! Spills!
The best cockroach racing this bazaar has to offer!
(cheering) Whoo! Yeah!
Giant cockroaches. Of course.
Now, then. Who has the guts to challenge
this strange-looking biped and her little pink boyfriend?
Whoa! Not my boyfriend.
Yeah, she's way too old for me.
Yeah. Wait, what?
(deep voice) I will take this challenge.
(all gasp)
The Wrecker! (gasps)
He hasn't been seen in years.
The Wrecker? The legend says he'll wreck yourself
if you don't check yourself.
Let's get outta here.
Oh, boy.
All right. Let's do this.
The race is on! (bell clangs)
-(horn tooting) -(revving)
On your marks.
(revving) Get set.
Go!
I've got 20 on The Wrecker. I've got 25.
I've got a rash.
(groaning)
Hey! That's cheating!
(all) Anything goes in the Bizaare Bazaar.
-(laughing) -Oh, no. They have signs.
It must be true!
Oh, anything goes, huh? Well, then I have a plan.
All right, Sprig. Tongue him.
Tongue him? I hardly know him.
Just do it, please!
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo! Oh, cool, it worked.
Huh?
(menacing laugh)
-(squeaks) -(grunts)
(both) We're gonna win! We're gonna win! We're gonna win!
(cheering)
(horn toots) Winner, winner, cricket dinner!
-(both coughing) -Well, that didn't feel balanced.
Our reigning champion takes the prize.
No!
Here you are.
You look fantastic.
No, no, no, no, no. Wait! Come back!
(gong clangs)
Oh, no. The bazaar's closing.
-(gasping) -Look. Pack it up.
The music box.
I-It's gone.
Now I'll never get home.
Hey, it's okay, Anne.
Maybe, uh, we can find someone who knows The Wrecker.
Track him down, you know?
The frogs in there said they hadn't seen him in years.
No, he's long gone by now.
Hey! (both scream) The Wrecker!
Look, I know you won my backpack,
but there's something inside I really need.
You gotta give it back. I'll do anything.
Hop Pop? Hop Pop?
I'm so confused.
Isn't it obvious, Anne?
I knew you two couldn't resist the Bizarre Bazaar,
so I decided to keep watch in case you got yourselves in a pickle!
Which you did. A big, fat pickle.
Hmm?
Anyways, here you go.
(gasps) Hop Pop! You're the best.
Thanks for having my back... pack.
You were right. I was too impatient for answers.
(unzips)
Here. Go through your trusted channels.
I'm okay with waiting a little longer.
I'll do my best, Anne.
I know how important this is to you.
Okay, back up. You're The Wrecker, Hop Pop?
How many games have you beaten? Did it ever get dangerous, Hop Pop?
Have you killed a man, Hop Pop?
(laughs)
Whatever happens in the Bizarre Bazaar stays in the Bizarre Bazaar.
Aw, man!
(chuckles) Just like Vegas.
Sure, Anne. Just like Vegas.
(Anne) Good night, Sprig! Good night, Hop Pop!
(Sprig) Night, you guys. (Hop Pop) Night, kiddos.
Sorry, Anne, but I can't have you showing this thing around.
Too dangerous for all of us.
Now it's where it belongs. Where no one can find it.
(grunts) (gasps)
(yelps)
What kind of evil person would live in a place like this?
(all gasp)
Hello, children.
(all gasping) Barry?
(laughs) Enjoying the curse I put on you?
Why, Barry? Why?
Why? I'll tell you why!
Surely you remember barging into me at the market yesterday?
Spilling my entire stock of blue moon berries
that only grow once every ten years.
They were priceless!
I played it cool and was sweet
because my image is half my business.
I may look nice,
but I'm petty and vengeful on the inside.
Yeah, that was our bad. Looks can be deceiving. We get it.
Ah, right, right. The lesson thing. Barry, we're sorry.
Please lift the curse.
You can't see it really, but I'm begging on my knees.
(coos)
Hmm, let me think. Never!
Not only am I petty, but I'm very unforgiving.
As a curse wielder myself, this abuse of magic offends me.
Hmm? Oh, goodness.
You should never curse someone unless they really deserve it.
And, buddy, you deserve it!
(gasps, whimpers)
Ah! Two can play at that game.
-Ha! -(grunts)
(both gasping, grunting)
(barrel squawks)
(growling)
(both grunting)
Ah! My last curse! (growls)
I'm out! What do we do?
Give me a hand. You mean literally?
Or figuratively? Ow!
Ow. What the heck?
(Barry exclaims)
Gotcha!
-Oh, dear. -Ha!
(explosion)
And that's how you fix a door.
(explosion)
Good job.
(coughing, squawks)
Oh, no. My beautiful body.
(all coughing)
We're back to normal! She turned the curses back on him!
Maddie, you did it! I can talk!
All right, you crazy kids bested me.
Now go on, turn me back.
Nothing doing. You're way too dangerous.
(caws) What? You can't just leave me like this.
Aw, come on, Maddie. We did him wrong.
(sighs) Fine. I'll change him back.
But for a price.
(Sprig) Any chance we could get some of this candy?
(Maddie) No way.
(caws) Good-bye, Kurt.
I'm not sure if all this was a blessing
or a curse. (caws)
It was literally a curse, Anne.
Thanks for helping us, Maddie.
And sorry the engagement had to end like this.
Friends?
Friends.
Whoa! I can't wait to hang out.
(owl hoots)
(snoring, croaking)
(glugs) Meh.
(gasps)
What, you got a better way to eat ants off the floor?
Sheesh.
(announcer) Welcome to Amphibia's Got Talent!
(cheering)
Hey, shoo! Go away, shoo!
(vocalizing)
Hoo-whee!
I'm thinking, launch him.
Yeah, way ahead of you.
(ground rumbling) (yelps)
(crowd cheering) Heh, heh.
All right, gang. This is ours to lose.
Sprig, you ready?
(coughing) As ready as I'll ever be.
Then get out there and win, win, win!
All right, next up is "Sprig Plantar."
Sprig? Ugh. Performing "Flight of the Moth."
(crowd gasps)
Well, hello there. I know. Right?
(classical, fast tempo)
(crowd exclaims)
(cheering)
It's working. It's working.
Now, Anne, the final touch.
On it.
(crowd cheering)
(crowd gasps)
It's perfection,
everything I could've hoped for.
(bat squeals)
-(crowd gasps) -(both yelp)
(Sprig screaming)
Whoa!
Aah! Sprig!
What do we do? What can we do?
(all scream)
Whoa-ohh-ohh!
(gasps)
Anne, get to that judges' table and wait for my signal.
Pardon me, saving my friend. Love your hair by the way.
Hang on, Polly.
(Sprig screaming)
-Now! -(grunts)
(both screaming)
(gasping, yelping)
(crowd gasps)
(gasping, yelping)
Polly, now's your time to shine.
Sing!
(gasps, inhales)
(inhaling)
- La  -(bat screeches)
 La 
(screaming)
Ah! I got you. I got you.
I got--
-(crowd cheering) -Outstanding!
Grandson? Are you okay?
Oh, I shouldn't have forced you into this.
Because of me and this stupid act,
you were almost digested.
Gah! All I wanted to do was to have... fun
and play my fiddle on stage.
Why'd you have to push me so hard?
Well, I just...
I ran into Wartilda, and she said--
And ascots are--
Vegetables are just not doing well anymore.
And heck, in a couple of years, I don't even know if the stand will be around.
(sighs)
I just wanted to give you a better life
than the one I can give you now.
Hop Pop, my life is perfect the way it is.
And as long as you're in it,
my future will be pretty cool too.
Oh... (sniffling)
-(crying) -(Sprig chuckles)
Absolutely mesmerizing performances.
I'm quaking with emotion.
And how did you ever train that bat?
Or this thing for that matter? Hey.
We hereby declare this family
the winning act of Wartwood's Got Talent.
(crowd cheering)
You simply must come tour with us.
Yes. And share your vision with the rest of the valley.
Thanks, but we like things the way they are.
We don't gotta be stars.
We will keep the trophy. It's gonna help us buy our house back.
(all laughing)
There goes the weirdest family I've ever seen. Absolutely, darling.
(clears throat) Well, Toadie,
I'd say that last act was pretty bad, wouldn't you?
(together) Oh, crud-- (scream)
(crowd cheering)
Sprig: Ah, Harvest Day. My favorite holiday.
Polly: I'm hungry just thinking about it.
Anne:: I get it. Frog Thanksgiving. You even have a turkey.
(shrieks)
Anne: (shudders) Eh, who am I kidding? I'll eat it. Harvest Day! I'm all in!
Hop Pop: Here, Anne. How 'bout you put these turnips "all in" our display?
Anne: All right, all right.
-(hammering)
Anne: Huh? Go Farmers? What's that all about?
The big bugball game, of course.
Every year, Wartwood plays a friendly game of bugball.
Farmers-- That's us-- versus the Townies.
Polly: And every year, the Townies destroy us! It's humiliating.
And to top it off, the losers have to wear these ridiculous costumes for a whole week.
(gobbling)
Those outfits are so itchy.
Anne: Whew, tough break, you guys. Hey, do you think I can make this?
(grunts)
Anne: Ha! (dabs) Three-for-three, baby.
(croaks)
Anne, where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Learn? I don't know if you've noticed, but I have natural athletic ability.
(fanfare, cheering)
You'd be perfect for bugball.
If you join our team, we might actually win!
Win? (laughs) Not in a million years!
Hello, Farmers.
Allow me to introduce this year's Townie team.
First, we got Lydia, four time frog-lympian.
-Olaf, who transferred from state. -(exhales)
Frog Jordan, who I literally bribed to join.
-What's up? -And last but not least, Toadie,
who is surprisingly good at this.
Mm-hmm, yes. Scary stuff, huh?
Be careful you Farmers don't soil yourselves on the field.
(laughs) Did you hear that? Soil?
-'Cause they're farmers. -(laughter)
(all groan)
Sorry, Mayor.
Farmers are gonna win this year because they've got me.
Cool!
We're gonna beat you and your fancy Townie team.
Well, I'll certainly enjoy watching you try.
Townies, move out.
Anne: We can still see you!
No, you can't!
Huh, guess I should probably learn how to play bugball.
-Oh, yeah, probably. -Yeah, that's a good idea.
(shrieking)
Archie: (panting)
Polly: What's up?
(grunting efforts)
Welcome to Team Farmers.
This is the playing field.
Those skulls are the goals.
And this is the bugball.
Anne: Oh, how cute. It's shaped like a real-- Ah! Real bug. It's a real bug. Got it. So we just put the bug in the goal, right?
Seems pretty simple.
Oh, there's more to it than that.
(straining effort)
Hop Pop: Now, see here. You got your shooters-- That's you and Croaker-- And you got your passers, me and Chuck. That's Chuck, by the way.
Chuck: I grow tulips.
Anne: Good to know.
And lastly, on defense, there's Sprig.
-(grunts) -'Cause he's not really great at the shooting part. Never scored a point in his life.
(squeals, deflates)
That's 'cause you never give me a chance.
Mm-hmm. Anyway, Anne, it says here
the most important thing about bugball is teamwork.
Uh-buh-buh-buh- buh-buh-buh.
Toss that playbook away,
'cause all we need is the "Pass it to Anne" play.
Huh!
Yuck! I don't know, Anne.
You're good, but the Townies are hard-core.
Yeah, Anne, I think the team should really--
Look, I don't usually do "team sports".
I do "me sports", like tennis.
Me sports, I win.
You guys wanna win, right?
Yeah. More than anything.
I grow tulips.
Well, then, trust me.
I got this.
-Ooh! Uh! -Whoopsie daisy.
Beat it, Farmers. We're here to practice.
Hey, Farmers have the field for another hour!
Oh, yeah? Well, our schedule says different.
Oh! (grunts) Ah!
(growls) (shouts)
Unless you'd like to scrimmage against us.
Eh, I think we need a little more practice before--
You're on! What?
Game on!
(Anne) Hop Pop, gimme!
Oh, okay, Anne.
Heh! (growls)
-Huh! -(laughs)
(crowd cheering) Okay. Let's try that again.
Anne, pass!
It's all good. I got this!
(groans) Again!
Anne, over here! I'm open, I'm open!
-(Mrs. Croaker) Anne, Anne! Over here! -I'm open!
(grunts) I'm taking the shot!
Huh?
-Mm. -(Anne groans)
(grunts) (Anne) Dang it.
Huh! (Anne) Dang it!
-(Anne) Dang it! Again! -(record scratch)
Yeah, no, that's the end of the game.
What? (Mayor) Field's all yours, Farmers.
Looks like we don't even need to practice.
(laughter) Ugh.
What the heck happened out there?
(sighs) This is why I hate team sports.
I'm always outnumbered. Outnumbered?
Look around you, Anne.
You have an entire team to back you up.
You're not the only one who can shoot. I grow tulips.
(sighs) In tennis, if I'm losing, I just play harder.
But this is different. I don't know how to win this.
Not you, Anne, we.
The only way we win is to work as a team.
What do you say, Anne?
Well...
Yeah, Anne, what do you say?
(groans) I guess I'll give it a shot.
That's the spirit! Yahoo!
Tulips! We can work with that!
(blows whistle)
(growls)
(laughs)
(cheering)
Yeah! Huh!
(gags)
Ah, refreshing.
(groans weakly)
-Ha! -(cheering)
All right, Anne, we got one final exercise for you.
True teamwork is all about trust.
Just listen to your team, and we'll guide you.
Uh, okay.
Dodge left!
Jump! Huh!
Now, stop. Turn slowly.
Can you hear me, Anne? Can you hear your dear, old Hop Poppy?
Yes, I hear you, Hop Pop.
Do you trust me, Anne?
I trust you.
Now, shoot!
(cheering) You did it, Anne!
You know what, guys? This teamwork stuff is actually pretty cool.
That's the spirit. You're finally a team player, Anne.
We can't lose! Tongue five, everybody!
(straining) Okay, I'll just do this.
(announcer) Ladies and gentle frogs,
-welcome to the annual big bugball game! -(cheering)
Give it up for Team Townies! Bring it on!
And the Farmers! We got it, we got it.
All right, frogs, listen up.
I want a good, clean game, right?
Now let's play bugball!
Farmers, are we ready?
(all agree) Tulips.
Everybody cover Anne.
(scoffs) She's never gonna pass it.
(whistle blows)
-Huh? -(all growl)
(laughs)
What the-- Huh?
-Whoo-hoo! -(cheering)
Well, looks like we got ourselves a challenge.
(laughs) (grunts)
(crowd cheering)
Toadie throw!
Over here, Hop Pop. (grunts)
This is it, folks, with only one minute left in the game,
whoever scores the next point wins! (laughs)
(all panting)
Come on, gang! We can win this thing!
Townies, huddle up.
Now their teamwork may have improved,
but Anne is still the only reason those yokels have gotten this far!
Looks like we may need to resort to drastic measures
to win this game, know what I mean?
By drastic measures, do you mean switching our focus
from the outcome to just having fun?
No, Frog Jordan. I mean cheat! Cheat!
Initiate plan "Last Resort".
All right, let's keep it clean, now.
(grunts) Sprig! Huh?
(laughs) (shouts)
My peepers! (whistle blows)
Blinding powder, eh? Well, that's a foul, as in foul play.
Toadie, you're disqualified!
Thanks for taking one for the team, Toadie.
By the time that powder wears off, we'll have won this game.
Oh, no! Our star player!
Well, saute my legs and serve me for lunch. We're done.
Never! We've done this before, and we're gonna do it again.
The trust exercise?
Uh, news flash, that didn't involve actual opponents.
There's no way we can pull this off.
Guys, you taught me that teamwork can make the impossible possible.
Also, I'm not actually crying, my eyes just won't stop watering.
Well, shoot, I'm crying, 'cause that was beautiful.
Anyway, let's do this.
(all) Yeah!
What? You're gonna play blindfolded?
Well, now I've seen everything. (laughter)
(laughs) That was funny.
Anne, go!
Jump! (grunts)
Dodge right! Dodge left!
Do a cartwheel!
Yeah, nice!
(together) Stop! Shoot!
Stop her!
(grunts)
Did I do it?
(yells in slow motion)
(slowed) No!
(buzzer sounds)
(crowd gasps)
(gasps)
(panting)
-(grunts) -(horn blares)
That's the game. Farmers win.
(cheering)
(groaning)
No! (blubbering)
Oh, oh, oh.
-(screaming) -(turkey gobbling)
Dude! You did it! Your first goal!
How's it feel? Amazing. I feel like a living god!
You did it, Anne. You did it!
No, we did it. This wouldn't have happened without my teammates.
Know what else wouldn't happen without teammates?
(Anne screams) (laughter)
Get them off me! Get them off me!
Sorry! (all munching)
Oh, this is worse!
(whistling)
Sprig: I still can't believe you're bringing us to a day care, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Look. I'm sorry, okay? But I have to go to the Annual Crop Convention. It's a long ways away, and I can't leave you kids on the farm alone for the weekend.
Sprig, Polly, & Anne: What?
Anne: Ugh! Are you kidding?
Hop Pop: Wish I was, Anne. But you kids need supervision. Why, sometimes it feels like we have at least two wacky adventures a week!
Hop Pop: Here we are!
Tritonio: Greetings, I am Tritonio Espada, the instructor of this day care.
Hop Pop: Huh, I thought Briar and Iris Bogwater ran this place.
Tritonio: The Bogwaters retired last year and sold their business to me.
Hop Pop: Well in that case, I'm Hopediah Plantar. This here is Sprig, Polly and Anne.
(Polly blows a raspberry. Hop Pop gestures to Anne.)
Hop Pop: She may be gigantic, but she's also a child.
Anne: Hey!
Tritonio: Ah, yes. I shall educate them! Teach them true discipline!
Hop Pop: Oh. I like the cut of your jib, Mr. Tray-tony. Did I say that right?
Tritonio: Absolutely not.
Sprig: This isn't so bad, I guess. There is a cool tower.
Anne: You guys don't get it. And Tritonio's a teacher, enemy of all that is good.
Sprig: Uh, what's so bad about teachers?
Anne: Let's just say, me and them don't mix.
Math Teacher: Okay, so then you carry the three and-- (sighs)
(video game noises)
Math Teacher: Not again.
(noises continue)
Anne: You'll never take me alive!
Math Teacher: Anne! Anne, get back here!
Anne: Teachers. They just don't like me. Probably cuz they're jealous of my carefree spirit.
Hop Pop: Well, kids, looks like you're in good hands here with Mr. Tritonio. Hyah! Crop Con, here I come!
Tritonio: Finally. It is just us now. So let us cast aside these illusions, yes? (tears off his clothes, revealing another suit underneath) Ah!
Anne, Sprig, & Polly: Whoa!
Tritonio: And this is no mere day care. This is a Combat Crash Course for kids.
Polly: Yoo-hoo!
Sprig: Cool!
Tritonio: Adults, they shelter their children. I say no! (kicks a stick up to him) Teach them to fight. For danger lurks around every corner of Amphibia. Stay on your toes! Trust no one! Ah! Look over there! (points behind Sprig)
Sprig: Ah! What is it? Danger?
(Tritonio hits him, making him grunt)
Tritonio: I said trust no one! Now, follow me, and we will begin the next lesson.
Sprig: Hit me again, Tritonio! (laughs)
Polly: This guy's awesome!
Anne: Eh, we'll see.
(Cut to inside the tower.)
Tritonio: Your next lesson is to pick your weapon. Find one that resonates with you.
Anne: Cool!
Polly: Yeah!
(Polly hops over to a bucket of mushrooms with skulls painted on them.)
Polly: Ooh, what are these?
Tritonio: Ah, the noble boom shroom. Small, unassuming, but in the right hands... (pushes on the stem, which causes the boom shroom to blink and make a beeping sound) Explosive!
(Tritonio throws the boom shroom, which explodes into a cloud of blue smoke.)
Polly: (gasps) Oh.
Tritonio: Perfect for you, I think. (hands Polly the boom shroom) Who's next? No wrong answers.
(Anne is standing near a stack of three swords.)
Anne: Hmm.
(She reaches for a sword, but Tritonio suddenly pops up from behind the stack.)
Tritonio: No! Wrong!
Anne: What? How so?
Tritonio: From what I have seen, you do not have the dexterity to wield a sword. Pick something else.
(Sprig walks up with a pair of sai daggers.)
Sprig: Whoa, these are big forks.
Tritonio: Ah, excellent choice, Sprig.
(explosion booms)
(Polly laughs)
Polly: So, what's the next lesson?
(The scene cuts to a tire-running course.)
Tritonio: Wonderful, Sprig! (Polly hops through the tires) Polly, truly inspiring. (Anne steps into a tire) No, Anne. Knees higher!
(The next lesson is monkey bars. Sprig uses his tongue to swing through.)
Sprig: Blah!
Tritonio: Sprig, Polly, nice work!
(Anne starts following them.)
Tritonio: No, Anne. More nimble!
(Anne grumbles, but then the bars break, causing her to fall and shout.)
(The next lesson is wall climbing.)
Tritonio: That's it, children! Feel the stone beneath your hands, the strong breeze in your hair. Much like the breeze on a fast-moving train.
Sprig: Man, Tritonio's so encouraging.
Anne: (sarcastically) Must be nice.
Tritonio: Anne, your hand placement is all wrong!
Anne: Ugh, what'd I tell you? The guy's totally picking on me.
Sprig: Why don't you just ask him why he's doing it? Tritonio says, "An honest dialogue is more powerful than any weapon."
Anne: Blech. That's the corniest thing I've ever heard--
(She lets go of the wall, only to fall screaming until she lands in a bush with a thud.)
Tritonio: Even your fall needs work, Anne.
(Anne sighs.)
(owl hoots)
Tritonio: Here, children, your quinoa macro bowls are ready. (looks around) Where is the gangly one? Does she not like quinoa?
Sprig: She said she wanted to be alone.
Tritonio: You must eat, Anne. Only a fool fights on an empty stomach.
Anne: Tritonio, can I ask you something? Why don't you like me?
Tritonio: What? I like you.
Anne: Oh, come on. You're always being super tough on me for no reason. Just like my teachers back home. Blech.
Tritonio: (laughs) Oh, Anne. If I seem tougher on you, it's not because I don't like you. It's because I see a girl who is not living up to her full potential.
Anne: Really?
Tritonio: Indeed. In you, I sense someone that, with a little effort could achieve greatness. And I am sure your teachers back home felt the same way.
(Anne smiles at Tritonio's words.)
Tritonio: And now, I believe you are ready for this. (takes out a sword)
Anne: Oh, wow!
(Tritonio hands the sword to Anne. She pulls it out of its scabbard, revealing a glowing blue blade.)
Tritonio: This blade has been in my family for many years, and now it is yours. Get some sleep, Anne, for tomorrow, the real training begins. (jumps off the tower) Way-ha-ho!
(Anne looks down at the sword, her face reflected on the blade. Then she smiles and sheathes the sword.)
(The next day, the kids are training, while Tritonio is sparring with Anne.)
Tritonio: Parry, swing! Imagine I'm a fearsome assassin. Or perhaps, a meddlesome train conductor.
Anne: (shouts) You're too fast.
Tritonio: Indeed. But when you find yourself outmatched, think outside the box.
(gasps)
(shouts)
(Anne grunts)
Tritonio: (laughs) Excellent! You've all improved so much. Especially you, Anne. (winks at her)
(Anne giggles)
Tritonio: Now, come. It is time for your final test.
(The group walks into another room.)
Tritonio: Tomorrow is our last day together. So I put together an exercise to test all the skills you've learned. I have rented a train, inside of which, I have hidden a fake priceless ruby. Also, I have hired actors to portray guards who will stop at nothing to keep the ruby safe. You must retrieve it using the wisdom and skills I have taught you. Now, study these plans. Become one with the plans. Eat the plans. (tears off a piece of the plan and eats it, his lips smacking. He then jumps away.) Eh, up! We leave at dawn!
Sprig: So does anyone else think this just looks like we're robbing a real train?
Polly: Yeah. Could Tritonio be using us?
(Anne slams her fists on the table, startling Sprig and making Polly scream.)
Anne: That's ridiculous! Tritonio's a good dude who believes in me. I think we should do it.
Sprig: Anne, you seem... oddly invested.
Polly: Yeah, where's old "teachers stink" Anne?
Anne: (dramatically) That Anne is dead and buried. (normally) Now come on, these plans ain't gonna study themselves.
Sprig: You got me convinced.
Polly: As long as I get to use my boom shrooms, I'm good.
(bell dinging)
(train horn blares)
Train Conductor: Huh? What the--
(horn blares)
(brakes squealing)
Sprig: Please, governor, I'm a poor orphan boy who done and twisted his wee ankle on these here train tracks.
Train Conductor: (sniffs) Poor kid. Guards! Help me!
Toad Guard 1: Another day, another wounded orphan to move.
(Anne and Polly laugh)
(squeals, snorts)
Toad Guard 2: This ankle isn't twisted.
Train Conductor: Hey! The train!
Toad Guards: Stop! Stop! No, no, no!
Train Conductor: Hey! Get back here!
(Sprig trips the conductor with his tongue, causing him to fall onto the guards.)
(Sprig laughs)
(Anne laughs)
Sprig: Acting is fun!
Train Conductor: I trusted you!
Sprig: Oh, my gosh!
(both grunting)
Train Conductor: Orphan!
Anne: Man, these guys are really good actors.
Polly: Never mind that. Let's get that ruby!
(rattling)
Anne: Polly, you're up.
(beeping, explosion booms)
(grunting, gasping)
Anne: There it is. We did it, guys. Big T is gonna be so proud of us.
Tritonio: Proud is an understatement!
(all gasp)
Sprig, Polly, & Anne: (together) Tritonio!
Tritonio: You've all done so well. Ah, here it is, the Tiger Moth's Eye. Now, I have one more question. What was the first lesson I taught you?
Anne: (gasps) Oh, oh! Trust no one!
Tritonio: Bingo.
-(door locks)
(Polly, Sprig gasp)
Anne: Tritonio, what are you doing?
Tritonio: Sorry, kids, but I never could've robbed this train by myself. And now that I have what I want, I'll be going. Give my regards to the guards! (laughs)
Anne: (grunts) I don't believe this. He double-crossed us. The first teacher I really clicked with ended up being a fake. Well, he's not getting away with this. Polly, got any more boom shrooms?
(weapons cocking)
Tritonio: Ah, they were good kids. Too bad they have to go to prison forever.
(beeping, explosion booms) (grunts)
Anne: Tritonio!
Tritonio: (laughs) I have to say, even I am impressed.
Anne: You really mean it-- Guys, now!
(both scream)
Sprig: Whoa! Whoa!
(Polly is ululating.)
Polly: Oh, hi, Sprig.
Sprig: (grunts) Oh, that hurt.
(beeping, explosions boom)
Tritonio: Come on.
(horn blaring)
(Anne screams, grunts)
Anne: Ah-- Huh?
(Tritonio kicks Anne in the face.)
Anne: Ooh! (panting, she stumbles backwards until she reaches the edge) Oh! (grunts)
Anne: Trusting you was a mistake, but you've made a huge mistake, too.
Tritonio: Oh, yes? And what is that?
Anne: You taught me how to fight.
Tritonio: Ah! Big T's eyes!
(both grunting)
(grunts)
Anne: School's out, teach.
Train Conductor: Thanks, kids. The tower's been trying to catch this slimeball for months. Been robbing trains with kids for quite some time now, the sicko.
Tritonio: You do have to respect my creativity.
Polly: We respect nothing!
Sprig: Yeah, get out of here, you fraud!
Tritonio: See you around, Anne. I wasn't kidding when I said you had potential. You certainly bested me.
Anne: Save it, you crook. I just have one more question for you. (pause for a bit) Was the goatee even real?
Tritonio: (picks out the goatee under his chin) What do you think?
(horn blows)
(all groan)
Sprig: Oof, you probably dislike teachers more than ever now, huh, Anne?
Anne: You know what? Tritonio might have been a crook, but he was onto something. When I get home, I'm gonna give my teachers another chance.
Polly: (monotone) Okay.
(horn beeps)
Hop Pop: Hey, kids.
Anne: How was the convention, HP?
Hop Pop: (slowly) Oh, fine. Didn't get swarmed by killer locusts, if that's what you mean. How was your weekend?
Anne: Good.
Sprig: We didn't rob a train.
Polly: Nope. No crimes committed.
Hop Pop: Good, good. Great to know we definitely didn't have two wacky adventures.
Bold
(Birds chirp as the screen shows a closeup of a ship's bow and sails before it zooms out revealing Hop Pop blowing a small ship's sails.)
(Hop Pop hums as he applies glue to piece of wood and puts it on the ship before he cleans it with a towel.)
Hop Pop: (sighs) Well, after five years of work on this gal, I might actually finish.
(A kickball suddenly crashes through the window. Hop Pop and quickly shields the ship as he dodges the kickball.)
Hop Pop: My baby! Whew! That was close.
Anne: Ooh, sorry about that, HP.
We're trying to teach Polly how to play kickball.
Which is challenging for obvious reasons.
Hop Pop: Dang it, kids! What have I told you about roughhousing near the windows? Now, come inside and play a quiet game. Hop Pop's working.
Anne: Yeah, I can see that. Nice toy boat.
Hop Pop: It's not a "toy boat," Anne. It's a replica of a famous warship.
Potato, tomato.
Scram!
(grumbles)
Tongue tag! If you get tongued, you lose.
Wait!
(laughing)
No. Kids, cut it out. I said a quiet game.
-No! -(laughing)
(distorted) No!
(screams)
Oops. (whimpers)
(grunts) Why don't you kids ever listen to me?
Okay. Everything's fine. We can still fix her.
To Loggle's!
-(screeches) -Okay, I'm going in.
Give Bessie some mushroom treats if she acts up.
You got it. (purrs)
Loggle! You've gotta help me save her.
(gasps) Is that a 1/80 scale model of The Green Lady?
Yeah! And she's damaged!
Wait here. I have just the thing.
Mm-hmm.
Excuse me, sir. (shouts)
Oh. Uh, hello.
Is that your snail out there? (Polly) Whoo-hoo!
(Bessie purring) Show 'em what you got, Bessie!
(siren whoops)
-Boo! -(sighs) Those kids are driving me insane.
Unruly kids, is it? Well, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Apothecary Gary. You can also call me Apothe-Gary if you'd like.
Yeah, I'm not doin' that.
Well, suit yourself. Anyway, I've got just the thing for your troubles. Just rub a little of this on their foreheads and your kids'll be behaving in a jiffy. See, it has these special enzymes--
Enzymes? (chuckles) Ol' Hopediah's not fallin' for no scam.
(laughs) Oh, it's not a scam.
I guarantee, once you've tried it,
you won't be able to live without it.
Eh, I don't know.
In my experience, this kind of malarkey never--
Apothe-Gary?
Here we go, Hopediah. (yells)
Did you get everything, Hop Pop?
Yup. Now all I need is a quiet afternoon to fix this old gal.
Well, listen, we'll be on our best behavior.
Yeah. The least we can do is give you the time to fix it.
Polly: We're sorry, Hop Pop. This is yours, by the way.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. For the apology, not the ticket.
Whoo-hoo! Shotgun!
Guess I won't be needin' this stuff after all.
Hey, shoo, girl. This ain't a snack.
I'll be in my study if anyone needs me.
(groans) I'm starving.
I think there's one more Beetle Bite left in the kitchen.
-Oh! -No, they're mine!
No! No, no, no!
Sorry, HP. Let me get that for you.
Don't you touch her!
(insects chirping)
(snoring)
(snoring)
Eh. Probably won't do nothin' anyway.
(yawns)
(rooster crows)
(sizzling)
Kids! Breakfast!
Dang kids always take so long to wake up.
Whoa!
(all) Good morning, Hop Pop.
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna start workin' on my ship.
So I want you kids to finish your breakfast quickly,
then sit on that couch and not say a...
word.
(all) Yes, Hop Pop.
Don't hate that.
(humming) There you go, Captain Happy.
(clock ticking)
(chuckles) Hey, kids.
(all) Hey, Hop Pop.
(shudders)
Um, why don't you kids go outside and play--
(all) Yes, Hop Pop.
(Sprig and Polly) Hooray.
Better close these to cut down the glare.
(insects chirping)
(yawns) Almost done.
Still, I shouldn't use any more of that gunk on the kids.
Something about it just don't sit right with me.
(yawns) (bones crack)
Man, I feel funky.
Like I was a prisoner in my own body.
I... I have all this anger,
and I don't know what to do with it!
Well, hey! Wanna shake it off with another game of tongue tag?
Heck yeah. Let's play in Hop Pop's room.
I like the obstacles.
No! Kids! Cut it out. (all yelling)
-Looking good! -(Polly shouts)
Go to bed now, and I'll give you ten coppers each!
Well, good night. Sleep tight.
I sure like money!
(sighs) I'll just buy myself a little more time, and then never again.
(snoring)
(yawns)
Well, that's that.
(eerie music)
(moaning)
(moaning)
(all grunt)
What's that?
(moaning)
(gasps)
Kids! What's gotten into you? Huh?
(singsong) Knock, knock.
Gary? What the heck are you doing here?
I'm here to witness the birth of my new children.
-Children? -That's right.
That potion I gave you was no ordinary elixir.
It was made with a special blend of my very own spores.
Your spores?
(gasps)
Behold! My true beautiful self.
You see, I am a rare species of mushroom able to control the mind of its host. And soon all of Amphibia will be under my command! (cackling)
You'll never get away with this.
Silence! Also, eyes up here, buddy.
Oh, sorry. It's just, you're glowing, he's got the mouth--
I know, right? It's totally weird. I completely get it. Now, where was I? Oh, right. To me, my mushroom children!
(moaning)
Mayor Toadstool: Simmer down now.
(cackling)
Welcome to the family, Hopediah-- Oh, he's gone.
We have to hold them off.
(moaning) Kids, snap out of it.
(Anne moaning)
Anne, no! Don't let them in.
(whimpers) Stay back!
(screaming)
(panting)
(grunts)
Well, I can't just leave her here.
I gotta get help. But everyone's infected except--
(gasps)
That's it! (panting)
(Polly screams)
Hop Pop: Shh! No, no, no. Polly, don't!
(shouts) No! Kids, let me go!
(cackling)
(thud) Little lower, please.
(moaning) Ah, there we go.
(moaning) Enough games.
Time for your assimilation.
Sorry to disappoint you, you compost-eating fiend, but I've got you right where I want ya. Goodbye, sweet lady. May you find safe harbor in the beyond. Hyah!
Bessie! Snack time!
Who's Bessie? Is that your wife?
(Bessie purring)
Aw, gee! (grunts)
(gasps) My spores!
(screams) Take this, you overgrown vegetable.
A vegetable? How dare you?
-(grunts) -Huh?
(Gary) Stop her! She's eating all the mushrooms.
(grunting)
(purrs)
Ah! No. Stop. Please!
Have mercy, I beg of you.
I'm the last of my kind.
Destroying me would wipe us off the planet forever.
I can live with that. (shouts)
(screaming)
(sighs) Huh?
What the-- What a wonderful dream.
Hey, where am I?
Mayor Toadstool: Why am I in the barn? What day is it?
Well, not the first time I've woken up in a shed.
I gotta go home. My wife's gonna kill me.
Lloyd: Hey, buddy. Do you know where I live?
Hop Pop: Nope. Sorry, Gary.
Lloyd: Gary? The name's Lloyd.
(Anne, Sprig and Polly) Ahem.
Hop Pop: (sighs) I know. No matter how important my ship was, it didn't give me the right to use mind control on you.
Anne: Uh, no.
Polly: Ya think?
Sprig: Heck naw.
Anne: But I guess we're sorry too. Looks like we pushed you pretty far. We'll try to be better about listening to you in the future.
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Yeah. I guess we're even.
Polly: Hop Pop, we broke a model ship. You crossed all kinds of ethical and moral lines!
Hop Pop: Like I said, even.
(grumbling) Yeah, whatever.
Fine.
Hop Pop: Now come on. I'll make y'all some mushroom soup.
Polly: All right.
Sprig: Sounds good.
Anne: I see what you did there.
Anne: Man, what is with this crowd? Are fruit flies on sale or something?
Hop Pop: (laughs) No. Today's the day they announce the Frog of the Year award.
Anne: Frog of the what?
Sprig: Frog of the hoppin' Year, Anne. Every year, the town gets together and votes on the frog they think best embodies the values of Wartwood.
Polly: We all voted last week. Don't you remember?
Anne: Huh. Not at all. Wonder why.
(Cut to a flashback of Anne sitting on the couch wearing earphones and listening to rock music. Hop Pop, Sprig, and Polly approach Anne from behind as music plays.)
Hop Pop: Anne, we're gonna go vote for Frog of the Year now. Wanna come?
(music playing)
Anne:  No, you'll never make me go! 
Hop Pop: Okay, then. (The Plantars leave.)
Anne: Break it down!
(Cut back to the present where Anne is thinking before she notices Mayor Toadstool walking up to a stage.)
Mayor Toadstool: All right, folks. It's time! (chuckles) As you all know, the Frog of the Year goes to the most selfless, noble, blah, blah, blah... Let's get on with it.
(He opens an envelope.)
Mayor Toadstool: And this year's Frog of the Year award goes to... Well, this can't be right. Anne Boonchuy?!
(Everyone in the audience gasps, but they burst into cheers, except for Anne who is surprised at this.)
Hop Pop: (pushing Anne to the stage) Go on, Anne. Get up there! A Plantar, Frog of the Year. I'm so proud.
(Hop Pop wipes a tear and it gets stuck to his finger.)
(Anne gets up to the stage and sees everyone giving her a big encore, making her feel extremely touched.)
Anne: Wow! Thanks, everyone. I don't know what to say.
Mayor Toadstool: I do. Are you people out of your frog-dang minds?! She don't deserve to host a party!
Anne: Party? What party?
Toadie: Oh, it's one of our oldest traditions. The Frog of the Year has to put on an incredible party for the whole town.
Mayor Toadstool: Yeah. And that party is supposed to demonstrate the Frog of the Year's selflessness. Anne isn't selfless. Far from it.
Anne: (stammers) You don't know me. I'll prove I deserve this by putting on a party so big, it'll blow all your minds! (echoes)
(all murmuring)
Frog: I don't want my mind blown.
Anne: That's... a good thing!
Frog: Oh, okay.
(crowd cheers)
Mayor Toadstool: I'm looking forward to seeing this thing go down in flames.
Anne: (grumbles)
(Cut to the Plantar farm, where Anne slams her plans for the party onto the table.)
Anne: Boom! Here are my plans for throwing the best party ever and proving that mayor wrong. Stupid mayor with his stupid dumb face.
Anne, don't worry about what the mayor said.
Just have fun planning your party.
You're Frog of the Year.
Anne: Right, right, right, right. Okay, guys, listen up. A great party has three ingredients: entertainment, exclusivity, and spectacle. Hop Pop, you're in charge of entertainment. I dub thee Master of Ceremonies.
Hop Pop: (gasps) I've been waiting for this day my whole life.
Anne: Polly, exclusivity. It's your job to decide who gets into the party and who doesn't.
Polly: (gasps) I can't wait to abuse this power!
Sprig: (singsong) And what about me?
Anne: Sprig, you have the most important job of all: the spectacle.
Sprig: Oh, my frog, oh, my frog, oh, my frog!
Anne: At the party...
Sprig: (squeal)
Anne: ...you're gonna tell Ivy how you feel about her!
Sprig: Wha-- Huh?
Anne: Yup. A legendary party needs a legendary spectacle. Can you imagine how excited party-goers will be to see true love blossom before their eyes?
Sprig: I'm not really sure I'm ready for this.
Anne: Sprig, please! I need your help to make this party amazing.
Sprig: (groans) Okay.
Anne: Whoo-hoo! Come on, everyone. Let's bring the thunder.
(all cheer)
(jackhammering)
All right, let's see how things are going.
Stumpy, stew's lookin' good. Decorations are up, glassware's looking polished.
Loggle, love that statue. Hey!
All right, Mr. Emcee, let's hear some jokes.
Okay. Have you heard about the snail who went on a diet?
He's a shell of his former self!
(drumroll)
Hmm. Okay, okay. A little soft, but keep working on it.
Sprig, my man. Let's see how that romantic proposal is going.
(clears throat) So it's gonna go a little something like this, okay?
Uh, Ivy, I got, uh, s-something to tell you, uh-- Oop!
(groans)
(yells)
Anne: No, no! This needs work too. (gasps) Polly? That's not what those are for.
Polly: (chuckles) Says you.
(grunts)
Mayor Toadstool: What'd I tell you, Toadie? She's gonna be the worst Frog of the Year ever. (Ever echoes)
Anne: (groans) No, no, no, no! I told you guys. This party has to be lit. At this rate, it's gonna be lame. Hop Pop, lemme see those jokes. (Hop Pop hands her the jokes) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know what? Written jokes are passe. Why don't you get up there and do some improv?
Hop Pop: Improv? I've never done that before.
Anne: Sprig, work on that proposal. Get some confidence. Come on. (to Loggle) Loggle! I'm gonna need you to re-do that statue. Make it cooler.
Loggle: You serious?!
Anne: Stumpy, you gotta throw that slop out and replace it with somethin' fancier. Like, I don't know. Sashimi.
Stumpy: What's a sashimi?
Anne: It's fresh fish, okay? Get it. Burn these decorations and get new ones. Replace that jug band with a deejay. And where the heck is that chocolate fountain?!
(groaning)
Sprig: Uh, Anne, do you think maybe you're taking this a little too seriously?
Anne: NO! Now, hop to it, everyone. We've only got 12 hours left. Hop! Hop!
(music playing)
(female) Oh, I'm so excited. (male) You said it.
Polly: You. You. Uh-uh! Not you.
Wally: Aw!
Polly: I'm just kidding, Wally. Get in there.
Wally: Validation! (cackles)
(all gasping)
Anne: Welcome, my friends, to the best Frog of the Year party ever!
(party music playing)
(all gasp)
Yo, I'm a frog deejay.
(male) Is that a chocolate fountain?
Mayor Toadstool: All right, Stumpy, what do we got here?
Stumpy: This is Sashimi. He's a mudskipper.
Mayor Toadstool: Ooh. And is it, uh, fresh?
Stumpy: Well, ya can't get fresher.
(gasps)
(screams)
(grunting)
(exclaims)
(nervous chuckles) All right, folks. It's time for some improv.
You, sir, where are you from?
I'm from the same town as you, buddy.
Oh!
Great.
(feedback screeching) (crowd murmurs)
-Whoa. -(gulps)
(sighs) I can do this, I can do this, I can do this.
(grunts) For Anne!
-(yells) -Oh, hey, Sprig.
(whimpers)
-(yells) -(techno music playing)
I don't know how to dance to this.
What?
Anne: Like this, you guys! Like this!
Hop Pop: Have someone else do your comedy, Anne! I can't go back out there!
Anne: Hop Pop!
(crowd screaming)
This thing's gonna kill us.
I know. It's loaded with mercury.
Anne: (sighs) This party stinks. Some selfless Frog of the Year I turned out to be.
(villager screams)
(all gasp)
(screaming)
(screams)
Loggle: At least the party's "lit" now, Anne.
(all screaming)
Anne: I'm fixing this right now.
(panting)
(shouts)
-Come here, you. -(neighing)
I knew it. Didn't I say it'd be a disaster? Ooh!
Mayor Toadstool, I need your help to save the town.
Me? Work with you? Ha!
(grunts) Okay, well, just this once.
Great. I'll steer, you grab.
Don't tell me what to do.
Upsy-daisy! I got ya.
Vote for me.
(all screaming)
We've gotta put this fire out. You ever use a chocolate fountain before?
What, are you kidding me?
(Anne) Now!
Let 'er rip. (grunts)
(laughs) Whoo! We did it.
Yeah. We did.
You were right about me, Mayor. I am selfish.
I got so obsessed with proving I deserve this, I ruined everything.
I'm no Frog of the Year. Why did anyone even vote for me?
Anne, we didn't vote for you because you're flawless. (chuckles) Far from it.
We voted for you because of how far you've come.
You've grown so much in your time here,
and this town just wouldn't be the same without you.
-(crowd cheering) -Hear, hear.
That's why I voted for her.
Mayor Toadstool: Gosh dang it, I tried to fight it, but I have to say, even I'm a little impressed with how you just saved the town from a raging inferno. Here. This belongs to you.
Anne: Thanks, Mayor.
Mayor Toadstool: Yeah, yeah. Don't mention it. Now come on, everyone. Let's try to salvage this party, shall we?
(all cheer)
(folk music)
Stumpy: All right. (guffaws) Who's a good little mudskipper?
Anne: Sorry I tried to rush you into confessing your love to Ivy. You do that when you're good and ready.
Sprig: Thanks, Anne. When the moment strikes, I'll know it.
Ivy: Hey, Sprig. There's something I've, uh, been meaning... to ask you. I, uh... Do you, um... (clears throat) Do you think you'd wanna go out with me sometime?
Sprig: (gasps)
Anne: (squeals)
Ivy: (Blushes in embarrassment) Never mind. I'm stupid. This is stupid. This is stupid.
Sprig: Ivy, wait! I'd love to. Mlep! Wanna dance?
Ivy: Heck yeah!
(both giggling)
Anne: (laughs)
Toadie: Ahem! Miss Frog of the Year? There's someone waiting at the bridge for you. They say they're a friend.
Anne: ...A friend?
(Anne goes out to the bridge. Aboard it is a hooded Sasha, now clad in toad armor; she takes off her hood in surprise...)
Sasha: Anne?!
Anne: Sasha?!
(screams)
(both laughing)
Anne: Oh, my gosh! I can't believe that it's you!
(both laughing)
Anne: Oh, my gosh. You're here too? I wasn't sure. I woke up all alone and... (gasps) Is Marcy with you? Where have you been? I've missed you so much!
Sasha: (giggles) I'll fill you in later. For now, I'm just glad I found you. We came as soon as we heard.
(Pause.)
Anne: (confused) "We"?
Sasha: Yup. Just me and some friends of mine.
(bug buzzing)
(crunching)
Captain Grime: Nice to finally meet you, Anne Boonchuy.
(intro)
(Three months earlier)
(Anne is biking her way to school. When she arrives, a girl approaches her while she's putting her lock on the bike rack.)
Maggie: Hey, Boobchuy! Whatcha eatin'? A puke bun? (cackles)
Anne: It's not a bun, Maggie. It's khao niew bing, a traditional Thai snack made up of rice and coconut milk. My mom made it for me because it's my birthday.
Maggie: Oh, happy birthday. Give me that!
Anne: Hey! Get your own Thai mom.
Sasha: Hey, Margot! Leave her alone! Also, nice guitar solo, Vince.
Vince: Yeah!
Maggie: Oh, yeah? Or else what?
Sasha: Or else you can forget coming to my awesome house party next week. It'll be really sad when the whole class is enjoying the pool without you.
Maggie: Aw, jeez, Sash. I was just playin'. Here.
Anne: Thanks, dude.
Sasha: No worries. You just gotta speak their language. But never mind that. Happy birthday, girl!!
Both: (Squealing)
Anne: Yes!
(School bell rings)
Sasha: Buzzkill.
Mrs. Virk: Alright, class. Today's your lucky day cause it's Frog Dissection day.
Boy 1: Gross!
(all groan)
Boy 2: Gross!
Anne: Ugh! Frogs are the worst.
Sasha: Right? Let's get outta here. (heaving) Mrs. Virk, the sight of blood... I-- I'm gonna be sick.
Mrs. Virk: Oh, dear. Anne, why don't you take Sasha to the sick room before she desecrates these beautiful frog bodies with her vomit? Thank you.
(both giggling)
Anne: Yo, Sash. Sick room's over here.
Sasha: (sighs) Forget the sick room. Forget school. Let's get out of here and celebrate your birthday in style.
Anne: Oof, skip school? I don't know, Sash--
Sasha: Anne, this is your 13th birthday. You only get one of these. So let's make it the best birthday in the history of birthdays.
Anne: Well... all right. I gotta be home by 6:00, though. My parents are throwing a big party and they really want me to be there.
Sasha: Right, right, you got it. Now let's get this thing started!
(laughter)
Sasha: Yes!
(game beeping)
(both grunting)
Anne: Whoo! Top score. (sighs) Phew!
(both giggle)
(siren wailing)
Anne: Ah!
Sasha: Whoo! Here we go.
(Anne screaming)
Sasha: Out of the way, Granny!
Anne: Whoa!
(laughing)
(Sasha whooping)
(slurping)
Anne: So that's what a unicorn tastes like. Corn syrup. (phone chimes) Huh?
(She looks at her phone. There are two messages from her mom; both say "Where are you?" and "Party starts in 15 minutes!")
Anne: Oh, shoot. It's almost 6:00. I gotta go, dude.
Sasha: Family party, right? Lame. Let me guess, a clown? With balloon animals?
Anne: (blushes) I know it's not the coolest, but this is important to them.
Sasha: Mmm-hmm. (gasps)
(phone chimes)
Sasha: Oh, my gosh. Marcy says she found the perfect gift for you downtown. (laughs) A frog music box for the frog lover. I wonder if those gems are real. (pushes Anne) Come on. Let's keep this party train rollin'. Choo-choo!
Anne: Sorry, dude, you don't understand. I really gotta go.
(Sasha becomes stern.)
Sasha: Oh, I understand, Anne. You're a good little girl who's gotta go home to her mommy and daddy. Come on. Hang out with your friends that love you.
Anne: Sasha, I'd really like to, but--
Sasha: (puts up her hand) Anne, this isn't cute anymore. We are meeting up with Marcy right now. End of discussion.
(Anne is shocked for a moment, but gives in.)
Anne: I guess it's okay if I'm a little late... (chuckles)
(Scene changes to outside, and Anne and Sasha exit the coffee shop holding hands.)
Sasha: Boom! I knew you'd change your mind.
(roaring)
(grunts)
(all screaming)
Anne: Sasha! The toads! I gotta go help my fr--
Sasha: Chill out, Anne. They're with me.
Anne: Wait, what?
Sprig: Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne!
(He and his family run over to the two girls.)
Sprig: Toads! They're everywhere. We barely slipped out while the guards were--
Polly: Holy toot, another Anne!
Anne: Oh. (chuckles) Guys, meet my bestie from back home, Sasha!
Sasha: Hey.
Anne: Sasha, meet the Plantars. This is Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Eh.
Anne: Sprig.
Sprig: Hey, hey.
Anne: And Polly.
Polly: 'Sup.
(Sprig hops over to Sasha.)
Sprig: Hey, I'm her bestie too. I guess that makes me your bestie-in-law. (laughs)
Sasha: (unimpressed) Does it?
(Sprig's smile drops. He laughs awkwardly while coughing.)
Sprig: Did y'all feel that? (coughs)
Hop Pop: Walk it off, boy. Yes, hi, nice to meet ya. Now, can someone please tell me why there's a toad army invading Wartwood?!
Sasha: You're Hop Pop? Thought you'd be taller.
Hop Pop: Huh?
Sasha: Relax, we're not invading anything. Come on, Anne. You too, frogs. We don't want to keep Grime waiting.
Hop Pop: Captain Grime?
Sprig: The cruelest toad soldier of all time?
Polly: Here?
Sasha: Ah, he's not so bad once you get used to him. Now hurry up, nerds.
Anne: (chuckles) She's persuasive, right?
Grime: Frogs of Wartwood! We toads have come here to...
(stammering)
Grime: ...invite you to a banquet!
(toots)
Grime: The moment we heard that Anne was here, we rushed over to reunite these two friends and hold a celebration.
Sasha: Aw, come here.
All: Aw!
Hop Pop: (skeptically) Really?
Grime: Yes. Despite my rough exterior, I really am just an "old softy".
(Sasha clears throat)
(growls)
(crowd gasps)
(baby cries)
Sasha: Uh, so, what do you say, Wartwood? You ready to party back at the tower?
(frog croaks)
Mrs. Croaker: What does Anne think?
Anne: Uh... Sasha's been my friend since kindergarten. If she says it's fine, it's fine.
Sasha: Whoo! All aboard the party barge!
-(music playing)
-(excited chatter)
Wally: Two parties in one night? Whoo-hoo!
Sasha: Psst, Anne, you're with me.
(snorts)
Anne: Wow, cool. Hey, mind if the, uh, Plantars come along?
Sasha: Of course, I don't mind. The more, the merrier.
Hop Pop: First class!
Sprig: I call window seat.
(laughing)
Polly: No, me! No, me!
Hop Pop: Kids, stop pushing. Ow!
(glass breaks)
Anne: (chuckles) They're fun.
(music playing)
Frog 1: Whoo-hoo!
Frog 2: Yeah! This is fun.
Sasha: So, here we are.
Anne: Ominous.
Sasha: Oh, Percy!
(Percy rushes over.)
Percy: Yes, Commander?
Sasha: I'm gonna give Anne a quick tour. Escort these frogs to the banquet hall.
Sprig: Hey, I wanna go on the tour too.
Polly: (gasps) Me three!
Hop Pop: Come on, kids. Give Anne and her friend a chance to catch up.
Anne: Don't worry. I'll find you guys later. Go have fun in there.
Sprig: (groans) We'll try.
(The Plantar family leaves with Percy.)
Sasha: You certainly seem close with those three. What happened to, "Ew, frogs are the worst"?
Anne: They're actually pretty great once you get to know them. (chuckles) I've been living in their basement since I got here.
Sasha: A basement? Yuck. Follow me. I'm gonna show you something crazy.
(Sasha opens the door to her chamber.)
Sasha: This is where I've been living.
Anne: Hoopa de boopa! Whoa!
Sasha: Yo, Brunton. (snaps fingers)
Brunton: (speaks in a French accent) Oui, Commander?
Sasha: Bring us the usual.
Anne: Pizza? Tacos? Hamburgers? Whoa, you've got ketchup?! It just occurred to me I've been eating bugs for a month.
Brunton: Anything else, Commander?
Sasha: Run the hot water, please. For the shower.
Anne: Shower?!
(laughter)
(slurps)
Polly: So, you experiment with other weapons or are you just a spear guy?
Mrs. Croaker: One more, and one more. One more. Last one.
Sprig: Uh, hey, Hop Pop? Something's not right here.
Hop Pop: Not right, yeah, sure. Here, Sprig, load up on crab legs. These babies go fast.
Sprig: No, I mean it. Don't the toads seem a little... on edge?
Hop Pop: Eh, they're a militarized culture, Sprig. I'm not surprised they don't know how to let loose.
Sprig: Ah, forget this. I'm gonna go find Anne.
Hop Pop: Good idea. She can carry more crab legs.
Sprig: Hey, pal, I'm just gonna go for a walk, get some fresh air--
Toad Soldier 1: No! Sorry. Uh, you frogs aren't allowed to leave this room.
Sprig: We're not allowed to leave? Why's that?
Toad Soldier 1: Uh... I've said too much. Please just return to the party and remain calm.
Sprig: Remain calm. You got it, buddy.
Toad Soldier 1: Whew, thanks, kid.
Sprig: Hey, everyone! This is a sham! We're not guests! We're prisoners!
Frog 3: Prisoners?!
Mrs. Croaker: What?!
(crowd screaming)
(The Toad Soldier starts whimpering)
Anne: Wow, Sash. This is so surreal. I can't believe you're really here.
Sasha: I know, right? (sighs) And once this is over, we can finally find a way out of this crummy, gross world.
Anne: (slurping) Once... what's over?
Sasha: Oh, the rebellion.
Anne: (chuckles) The what now?
Sasha: You don't know about the rebellion? Look, I'll explain. Just promise not to freak out or anything.
Anne: O...kay.
Sasha: So you've probably already noticed that the toads in this valley have one job: to rule over the frogs. And lately, those frogs have been stepping outta line. It turns out these "rebels" have been inspired by a certain frog. You might just know him. Stood up to some tax collectors, even ran for mayor against the local toad.
(She hold up a poster, which unrolls to reveal Hop Pop.)
(Anne pulls a spit-take with her cocoa.)
Anne: (coughs) What?! Hop Pop's not a revolutionary!
(Sasha throws down a bunch of newspapers with Hop Pop's image on the front pages.)
Sasha: Doesn't matter. Word has traveled like wildfire, and we've got to make an example out of him. (takes Anne over to a window) So, the toads are just gonna feed him to that thing.
(Outside, Grime and his soldiers are struggling to keep a giant Venus fly trap under control.)
Grime: Hold her steady, boys!
(roaring)
(Anne gasps in shock.)
Sasha: Okay, here's the thing. I struck a deal with Grime. I'd help him capture Hop Pop and crush the rebellion, and Grime and his army will help us find a way home. The whole banquet trick-- My idea, obvi. Now we've got those slimy frogs right where we want them. Isn't this great?
Anne: Uh... I have to, uh... go to the roomrest, uh, the restroom. (laughs, bumps into the Sasha bust) Whoa. (stands the bust back up) Stay. BRB.
(bullet ricochets)
Sasha: (slurps) Oh, she's totally freaking out.
(crowd yelling)
Wally: I'm totally freaking out!
Toad Soldier 2: Calm down, you frogs, calm-- (grunting) Knock it off!
Frog 4: They're gonna eat us!
Mrs. Croaker: Not on my watch. Take that. And that!
Polly: Ooh! I wanna riot too!
Hop Pop: Polly, don't throw that. Throw this potato instead.
Polly: Hyah!
(grunts)
Wally: Let me out! Let me out!
(all gasp)
(Ivy empties her plate, then throws it at one of the soldiers, denting his helmet in the process.)
Toad Soldier 3: (groans) Ouchie!
Toad Soldier 2: All right, that does it! (pulls out his mace)
(Suddenly, the doors fly open, and a cloaked figure enters.)
Anne: Enough! Guards, leave us. I'll get these frogs to fall in line.
Toad Soldier 2: You lot have made a huge mistake.
Toad Soldier 3: Enjoy your time with Commander Sasha.
(gulps)
(laughs menacingly)
Anne: (pulls back her hood) Hey, guys.
(all gasp)
All: Anne!
Sprig: Anne!
(He jumps into Anne's arms.)
Sprig: Boy, are we glad to see you. We've got a situation. We're not guests. We're--
Anne: Prisoners, I know. And it's worse than that. They're planning to execute Hop Pop!
(all gasp)
Hop Pop: Say what?! But why?
Anne: Turns out Hop Pop's been inspiring rebellions all across the valley. Blah, blah, it's some political nonsense.
Hop Pop: Well, it's a good-looking poster, though. (beat) I'm gonna die!
Mrs. Croaker: Don't worry, youngster. We won't let 'em get you.
Felicia: So what do we do?
Anne: Nobody panic. I'm busting us out of here. Somehow. Anyone got any ideas?
Loggle: I do...n't. I don't.
All: Aw, come on!
Sprig: Geez, Loggle.
Wally: I've got one. What say we plant these boomshrooms around the joint? Blow the place sky high.
Anne: With us still inside? We're not doing that.
Wally: Right. We're not doing it.
Anne: Seriously. No boom shrooms.
Wally: Loud and clear.
Anne: Okay. Gotta figure a way out. Hmm. There's only one door, and the toads are outside it. There has to be some other wa-- (sniffs) (gasps) That's it! (grunts) The sewer.
Felicia: (sniffs) Oh, yuck, really?
Polly: Deal with it, lady. It's time to get dirty!
Felicia: Don't touch anything.
Mayor Toadstool: Oh, help me, Toadie.
Toadie: I got you, sir.
(rumbling)
(gasps)
(all scream)
(screeching)
Mrs. Croaker: Back, back, you filthy vermin!
(humming)
Wally: Just a little gift for our generous hosts. (laughs)
(beeping)
Anne: (gasps) Finally! I think we made it.
(Anne throws open a manhole cover.)
Anne: Ah! Fresh air.
(She suddenly finds herself surrounded by toad soldiers.)'
Sprig: Boy, those toads really stink!
(He then notices the situation they are in.)
Sprig: Did I say stink? I meant, are very handsome.
(Sasha, wearing her armor once again, walks between the toads.)
Sasha: (sighs) Anne, Anne, Anne. Very disappointing. Now let's move. Grime's waiting for us.
(snarls)
(scoffs)
(chuckles)
Sasha: Caught these prisoners trying to escape, Grime.
Anne: Dude, are you crazy?
Sasha: Shh. I'm trying to get us home.
Grime: Very impressive, Sasha. Always playing Flipwart when everyone else is playing Bog Jump.
Anne: Huh?
Sasha: Wha...
Grime: Well, see, Flipwart and Bog Jump are games, but Flipwart, of course, is far more complicated and... I'm trying to say you're smart!
Sasha: Oh. (laughs) Thanks, Grime-sy. What can I say? Just how I do. Up top.
Grime: Ah... Um... Yes.
(The Plantars all grumble.)
Anne: Sasha, please! There has to be another way! Oh!
Grime: There is no other way, creature. Our very way of life is at stake. I don't expect an outsider like you to understand. Seize the traitor, Hopediah Plantar.
Hop Pop: No! Get your hands off me!
Sprig: Hey!
Hop Pop: Kids!
Anne: No!
(grunting)
Toad Soldier 4: Hey, that's mine.
(grunting)
Anne: Stay back!
(grunting)
(groans)
Wally: Do your worst.
Felicia: Oh, if you're gonna bring it, then bring it.
Toad Soldier 5: In retrospect, we really should have tied them up.
Sasha: Enough!
(The toads part away, revealing Sasha. She strides over to Anne.)
Sasha: Anne, what are you doing? Are you really gonna risk your life for these talking frogs? We don't even belong here. Don't you wanna get back home? See your family?
Anne: (hesitantly) Yeah, but--
Sasha: Then put your sword down now. End of discussion.
(Anne's shocked expression changes to a nervous one. She looks around, then sadly lowers her guard.)
Sasha: (offscreen) There we go. That's my girl.
(Sprig looks upset at what's happening.)
Sasha: There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
(Suddenly, a sludgeball strikes Sasha in the face.)
Sasha: What the heck?!
(all gasping)
Sprig: For someone who's Anne's best friend, you sure don't know her very well. She's brave! She's smart! And most of all, she's not gonna be pushed around by a bully like you!
(Anne smiles, touched by Sprig's words. Sasha wipes the sludge off her face.)
Sasha: (grunts) I think I've had enough of you, squeaky toy. (grunts)
Sprig: (yells)
(sword clanks)
Sprig: (gasping)
Anne: (grunting)
Sasha: Anne, what are you doing!?!
Anne: (infuriated) Something I should have done a long time ago: Standing up TO YOU!
Sasha: (gasps)
Anne: Thanks for believing in me, Sprig.
Sprig: Spranne against the world.
Grime: (chuckles)
Sasha: What are you laughing at?
Grime: Looks like you've got a rebellious seed of your own. You've given me plenty of advice. Now let me give you some. Stamp this out. Make her yield. Fail, and nothing will ever be the same.
Sasha: Not gonna happen.
Grime: This should be fun. My friends! Instead of a messy free-for-all, I have a splendid idea. How about we settle this (jumps onto a rock) the toad-fashioned way? (snaps fingers)
(Toad guards surround Anne and Sasha.)
Grime: Trial by combat! If your champion wins, you all go home, no harm, no foul. But if our champion wins, well...
(Venus flytrap roars)
Grime: (laughs) Baby's hungry.
Hop Pop: Anne, you don't have to do this.
Anne: Yes, I do.
(Anne and Sasha circle each other, the atmosphere intense. Then they stop and face each other, glaring. All is silent, then...)'
Grime: Begin!
(grunting)
Sasha: What's gotten into you, Anne? You were never like this back home!
Anne: Do you ever stop talking?!
(grunts)
(gasping)
Anne: Haha! (Sasha knocks her sword away) Oh, come on, a dagger?
(both grunting)
Sasha: They're just slimy little frogs, Anne! They don't matter!
Anne: They're not just frogs. (picks up sword) THEY'RE MY
FRIENDS!!!
(She swings her sword forward, knocking both Sasha's sword and dagger out of her hands. Sasha falls backwards and lands on her butt. She now has a scar below her right eye. Anne points her sword at her.)
All: Whoo-hoo!
Polly: Go, Anne!
Hop Pop: Go, Anne!
Anne: It's over, Sash. You're not gonna push me around anymore.
(Sasha, defeated, glares at Anne.)
Anne: So how about it, big guy? We're free, right?
Grime:Yeah, I don't think so.
Anne: Whoa!
Sprig and Polly: Hop Pop!
(yelling)
Grime: Pretty cool, huh? This ends now.
(rumbling)
Grime: What the... What?!
Anne: Wally, what did you do?!
Wally: What? I thought we agreed. Wait, could you not tell I was winking? Ah, curse you, one eye!
(gasping)
(crowd screaming)
("Lean On Me" plays)
Toad Soldier 5: We gotta get out of here!
Grime: Hold ranks! Where are you going, you cowards?
Hop Pop: Ah! Eh, I never liked that guy.
Toad Soldier 6: Move, move, move!
(screams)
Hop Pop: Everyone! Come on, get off the roof, quick!
(man humming "Lean On Me")
(screaming)
Sasha: Whoa!
(whimpers)
Sasha: (gasps) Anne! (screams)
Anne: Sasha!
(screams)
Anne: Gotcha.
 Sometimes in our lives 
Anne: I've got you, Sash. You're gonna be okay-- (screams, grunts)
 We all have pain 
(screams)
(whimpering)
- We all have sorrow 
Hop Pop: I think that's everyone.
(Anne shouts)
Sprig: (gasps) Anne!
Anne: Can't... hold on... much longer.
- But if we are wise 
Sprig: Don't worry. I got you-- Oh!
Hop Pop: (grunting) Hold on, kiddo.
(screams)
(Anne grunts)
Anne: Hey, hey. Look at me, look at me.
 Lean on me 
Anne: Everything's gonna be totally fine. Just hang on.
 When you're not strong 
Hop Pop: We got you, Anne. No matter what.
(grunting)
 I'll be your friend 
Polly: Uh, guys? I think we have a situation.
 I'll help you carry on 
 For, it won't be long 
(straining)
Sasha: Hey, Anne?
 Till I'm gonna need 
Sasha: Maybe you're better off without me.
 Somebody to lean on 
Anne: No!
(music stops)
(wind whooshing)
Grime: Hyah!
(squeals)
(screaming)
Mrs. Croaker: Curse these old legs.
(grunting)
Wally: Hi, Mrs. Croaker.
Mrs. Croaker: Mayor Toadstool?
Mayor Toadstool: Uh-huh. If y'all die, who'll I embezzle money from? Huh?
Mrs. Croaker: Shut up and run!
(growls)
Sprig:Anne, are you... okay?
Anne: Oh, yeah. Never felt be-- (cries)
Polly: Aw.
Mrs. Croaker: Whoa, girl. Easy now. All right, everybody, we're home.
(all sigh)
(groaning)
Wally: Two parties in one night.
Toadie: Think you could carry me again, sir?
Mayor Toadstool: (groaning) Never again, Toadie. Never again.
Hop Pop: I know that was hard for you, Anne. Thank you, you know, for everything.
Anne: Hop Pop, you three are my family. I'd never let anyone hurt you.
Sprig: So, you guys wanna get breakfast and come up with some kind of plan to get Anne home?
Hop Pop: It's gonna be dangerous. Perilous even.
Polly: Understatement!
Anne: Well, whatever happens next, one thing's for sure. (brings the family in for a hug) If we're together, I know we'll be all right.
Hop Pop: Hugging a little tight there, Anne.
Anne: No, I'm not.
(Title: END OF PART 1)
(The episode begins with the fwagon, being driven by Hop Pop, passing through a valley, while Sprig and Anne are inside watching a series on Anne's cell phone.)
Mariah: Don't you get it, Mother? I know you want me to be a ballerina, but my heart belongs to hip-hop. (She performs a brief breakdance.) Are you disappointed?
Mariah's Mother: No, I'm proud of you. All that hipping and hopping was breathtaking.
Mariah: Oh, Mother.
Mariah's Mother: Oh, Mariah.
(Anne starts crying.)
Anne: And that is the masterpiece, From Pointe to Poppin.
Sprig: Talk about an emotional roller coaster--
(The fwagon stops abruptly and Sprig falls.)
Sprig: Whoa!
Anne: Sprig! You all right, buddy? What the heck is going on out there?
Hop Pop: Come on, Bessie. Come on.
Bessie: *chirps*
Hop Pop: Almost there.
Bessie: *chirps*
(Bessie's reins break.)
*all gasp*
Hop Pop: Oh, dang it! The ding-dang reins snapped.
*sheepbug bleats*
Bessie: (sees a sheep) *chirps* (goes to the sheep)
Sheep: *bleats*
(The sheep runs, being chased by Bessie.)
Hop Pop: *screams* We gotta get these reins fixed or we can't control Bessie.
Sprig: Don't worry, Hop Pop. There's a town right down the road. See? Ribbitvale.
Hop Pop: Ribbitvale? The most expensive town in all Amphibia? No way!
*all scream*
Anne: Looks like we don't have a choice, HP.
Bessie: *purrs*
Sheep: *bleats*
Hop Pop: *sighs* You're right. But when we get there, don't get sucked in by the fancy.
(They take the fwagon to the entrance of the city.)
*all sigh*
Polly: Guys, look.
(They see a lot of fancy buildings around them.)
Polly: So shiny. So sparkly. *screams*
Hop Pop: Hey! Hey! I said look away from the fancy.
Sprig: It's like nothing I've ever seen before. A ten-tier fountain. A solid gold snail carriage. There's even a One-Eyed Wally. Wait. What?
All: One-Eyed Wally?
Anne: You didn't tell me you were leaving the valley, you scamp.
Wally: Oh, um--
Wigbert: Walliam, you know these pungent common folk, do you?
Wally: Uh, yes, Father. I met them on my business travels.
Wigbert: These must be your servants from Wartwood then.
Hop Pop: Servants?
Wally: Yes. That's right, Father. These are my servants. *groans*
Wigbert: (referring to Anne) And this must be some kind of exotic beast you tamed. Though I sooner would have had it stuffed.
Anne: *grunts*
Wigbert: *laughs* Anyhow, I am Wigbert Ribbiton.
Hop Pop: Ribbiton? As in Ribbiton's Ribbons? The finest web crusty floss in all of Amphibia?
Wigbert: That's us. And when I retire, Walliam here will be head of the Ribbiton family empire. Right, Walliam?
Wally: Right, Father. Can't wait for that. *sighs*
Anne: Hmm.
Wigbert: Hello. Looks like someone needs repairs. My mechanics will make her right as rain in no time.
Mechanics: Hup, hup, hup, hup.
Hop Pop: Oh, mighty kind of ya.
Wigbert: You'll be joining us back at the mansion, of course?
All: Mansion?
Wally: Oh, no. They couldn't--
All: Oh, yes, we could!
(The door to the mansion opens.)
Wigbert: Here we are.
(They walk towards the entrance of the mansion.)
Wigbert: Some of my prizewinning birds. Ever seen a frog torn in half by a peacock? Grizzly stuff.
*peacock shrieks*
(Inside the mansion.)
Wigbert: It's, uh, one of our smaller rooms but please enjoy.
(The plantar and Anne enter Wally's bedroom.)
Anne: What the heck, Wally?
*all gasp*
Hop Pop: This place is magnificent.
Anne: What happened to "Look away from the fancy?"
Hop Pop: It don't count if ya don't have to pay for it.
Sprig: Hey, let's go explore.
Hop Pop: Okay.
*all laugh*
Anne: So... Walliam, what's going on here? I thought you were a fun-loving tramp, not some little rich boy.
Wally: The truth is I live like a bum in Wartwood because... Well, it's what I love. This life may look nice but there's so many rules. And if my family knew the real me, well, they'd disown me for sure.
Anne: Just be honest with them. Tell them the truth and I know they'll support you. Just like my favorite movie From Pointe to Poppin.
Wally: *grunts* (pulls his accordion out of a hole in the floor) It's just too risky, Anne. I have to hide these around the house, or I'd lose my mind.
Anne: What about that time you told me not to care what people think about you?
Wally: This is different. This is my family we're talking about.
Anne: I still think you should be honest with them. I mean, what do you have to lose?
Wally: Well, come with me and I'll show you. (walks and bumps into the wall) Meant to do that.
Anne: Yeah, yeah. Of course.
(The Plantars are walking down the hallway.)
Polly: Welp, we're lost. Probably gonna be stuck here forever.
Sprig: Oh, I know. Let's just open some doors at random. One of them's gotta be an exit.
(They open a door and see that in the room there are several frogs taking a steam bath.)
Frog: *groaning*
Hop Pop: Sorry, we're just-- Carry on. (closes the door)
(They open another door.)
*all gasp*
(In the room there's some broken furniture and there's three masked frogs hitting a chair with bats.)
Female Frog: (kicking the chair to pieces) Hi-ya!
(They close the door.)
(They open another door. In the room there are several peacocks.)
Peacock: *shrieks*
(One of the peacocks turns and turns out to be a frog in disguise.)
Frog: Shh.
All: *sigh* (leaves)
(Anne and Wally enter a stable.)
*horse whinnies*
Wally: So much of my past is here. It would break my heart to leave it all behind. (opens one of the doors)
Beetle: *chirps*
Wally: Meet Fiddle Leaf. I've been riding her since I was a wee tadpole.
Anne: Aw. (sees a picture of a happy Wally and his beetle from years ago then sees the real deal looking miserable) Ugh. Well, if you're not gonna tell 'em, what are you gonna do?
Wally: Maybe if they could see how happy I was living in Wartwood, they'd understand and accept me for who I am. *groans* Who am I kidding. Well, I better go get ready for dinner.
Anne: Right. Dinner.
(Wally leaves. The Plantars come in.)
Anne: Hey, where you guys been?
Sprig & Hop Pop: Around.
Polly: Rich people are messed up.
Anne: Dude, I've just spent the last hour talking with Wally about how miserable he is. Well, tonight I'm gonna help him come clean.
Sprig: Oof. Are you sure meddling is a good idea?
Anne: Pfft. It's not meddling. It's the right thing to do because it happened in a movie. And movies are never wrong.
Sprig: Okay.
(Later, in the dining room.)
*chattering*
Frog: I hear the market has really taken off.
Wigbert: *clears throat* A toast to Walliam's valet. *shrieks*
*all shriek*
Anne: *clears throat* Great segue. To thank you Ribbitons for your hospitality, I have prepared a special presentation.
Frog: It talks. Oh, capital.
Anne: Gonna ignore that. Now, please enjoy this video of Wally's life in Wartwood. Edited by me. (plays a video on her cell phone)
Wally: Wait. What?
*beeps*
(First is seen Wally playing the accordion.)
Wally:  Oh, I'm a vagrant With a heart of gold  (falls) Aw. Whoop.
*cat yowls*
(There's another video where Wally's in a chicken coop with some chickens.)
Anne: Wally.
Wally: What can I say? I sleep better with company.
(Another video is seen where Wally is bathing in the town fountain.)
Wally:  La la la la laa La la laa 
*whistle blows*
Wally: Ooh. Gotta go. *laughs* (falls)
Cops: Oy, oy, oy!
(The cops beat up Wally.)
(The video ends.)
Anne: Cue emotional acceptance.
Wigbert: *clears throat* Walliam! That is how you've been acting outside of Ribbitvale? Unacceptable. You have brought shame onto the house of Ribbiton. Worse, you've been lying to us.
(Anne's face falls in realization that she messed up.)
Wally: I-I only lied because I didn't think you'd accept the real me.
Wigbert: Well, you weren't wrong. We do not accept this. You are henceforth forbidden to leave this town.
Wally: *gasps* Then you leave me no choice.
(Wally takes off his ribbon, rolls it up on a knife and spins it around the table.)
*screams*
*gasps*
(The knife hits a gong.)
Anne: What? What does that mean?
Sprig: Family challenge.
Hop Pop: Come on, Anne. You've been here long enough.
Wally: If my family won't accept me for who I truly am, then I don't want to be a Ribbiton anymore. I challenge you to a winner-takes-all duel!
Wigbert: Very well. One-on-one Beast Polo. You win, you can leave Ribbitvale and live however you like. You lose, you take over the family business and stay in Ribbitvale forever.
Frog: *gasps*
Wally: I accept.
Anne: *groans* Kinda went off script there.
(In the hallways, Wally stomps off as Anne walks alongside him.)
Wally: Why did you do that?!
Anne: You told me this is what you wanted. (jigs past him and stops in front) You said, "I wish they could see me in Wartwood."
Wally: But I didn't actually mean it.
Anne: Look, I just wanted to help you be proud of who you are. A poppin' lockin' fresh don't stoppin' hip-hop B-girl!
Wally: A what?
Anne: Never mind. What can I do to fix this?
Wally: You know what, Anne? You've done enough already. I've got to face the music on my own. (leaves, playing the accordion)
*music plays*
Anne: Ugh.
(At the polo field.)
Crumpet: Hi-ho, Crumpet the Frog here, and welcome to the official Ribbiton family challenge. A ribbiting game of Beast Polo. Hey, see what I did there? Ribbiting, riveting? Because we're frogs?
Hop Pop: Well, this guy's quite the character.
Crumpet: Okay. Here comes the ball now!
Polly: I don't see any--
(Wigbert takes his monocle off his right eye, then pulls a ball out of the socket and puts it on a pad.)
All: *gasps*
Crumpet: *groans* And now the players will pick their beasts.
Wigbert: I choose Andromeda.
Andromeda: *grunts*
Wally: And I choose Fiddle Leaf.
Fiddle Leaf: *chirps*
Wigbert: Not so fast. Fiddle Leaf is a Ribbiton family beast. Since you no longer wish to be a Ribbiton, you can't ride any of them.
Wally: Well, then what am I supposed to ride?
Anne: I'll be your beast!
Wigbert: What in heavens?!
Wally: Anne?
Anne: Look. If you're gonna go down, you might as well go down fighting. Plus, I got you into this. At least let me try to get you out.
Wally: All right. You know how to do this?
Anne: No, but I'll figure it out.
Wally: Well, here. Put this bit in your mouth. (gives Anne a rein)
Anne: (slaps the rein to the ground) Not happening, bud.
Crumpet: Okay, fellas. Let's keep this game cool and friendly-like. Three, two, one. Ee-eee!
Wigbert: Hiya!
*nickers*
Wigbert: Hiyah!
(The ball sails right between Anne's legs and into the goal.)
Crumpet: Crump Sir Ribbiton has scored the first goal.
*crowd cheering*
Wally: Turns out dad's still got it. We might be in trouble.
Anne: Well, then come on. Let's step up our game and demolish this old man!
Wally: Steady. He's still my dad.
Anne: Sorry, I'm just so competitive!
(The ball is put on the field.)
Anne: Ready?
Wally: Ready.
*whistle blows*
Crumpet: That beast may be small, but it sure is agile. A goal for Walliam.
Wigbert: *grunts*
*crowd cheering*
(It's seen moments in the game where sometimes Anny and Wally score, and other times Wigbert does.)
Crumpet: All right, folks. This is it. Next goal wins.
(Anne with Wally and Wigbert run in the field, but Anne stumbles.)
Anne: (falls) *grunts*
Wigbert: *laughs*
Wally: Oh, no!
Wigbert: (throws the ball) *grunts*
(The ball bounces off a goalpost.)
*Andromeda whinnies*
Wigbert: *grunts*
Wally: Ah. He missed.
Anne: Second wind!
Wally: Come on, Anne. We're so close.
Anne: He's too fast. We'll never make it.
Wally: That's what you think. (pulls his accordion out of Anne's hair)
Anne: Wally, how long has that been there?
Wally: *chuckles* A season at least.
(Wally uses his accordion to hit the ball before his dad gets it.)
Wigbert: *gasps*
Crumpet: Goal! Walliam wins.
*crowd cheering*
Hop Pop: Ooh. They won!
Anne & Wally: We did it!
Wally: I can finally be myself.
Hop Pop: Can't be yourself without your signature hat.
Wigbert: Ow! *clears throat* Well, son, I concede defeat. I suppose this means goodbye forever. *sobs*
Wally: I don't want to leave forever. I just want to be able to be me, wherever I am. (hugs his dad)
Wigbert: You mean you still want to be a Ribbiton?
Wally: Of course, I do. But you have to accept me for who I am. Both Walliam and Wally.
Wigbert: I suppose we can do that. Ah, accordion, eh? You know, I used to love playing the jug, but I gave it up a long, long time ago. Oh, all right. You got me. *grunts* (reveals a hole in the field where he was hiding jugs)
Wally: You've been holding out on me.
Crumpet: Aw. Isn't this great? I just love happy endings. What do you say? How about a song? Always works for me.
Wigbert: I don't see why not.
Wally: Thanks, Anne, for everything. Well, not everything.
Anne: Don't mention it.
Wally: Hit it, Pops.
(Wally and his dad start playing.)
(A peacock appears and shrieks, causing everyone to scream.)
(Anne and the Plantars have arrived in Stony Gulch, parking Bessie and the fwagon outside the town's entrance before entering.)
(all) New town! New town! New town!
(gasps) Food. Shops.
This place is so cool.
What should we do first?
Hop Pop: Let's see. (He opens his wallet.) Nothing. All we can afford is window-shopping, kids.
(all sigh) Aw.
Anne: Man, it's hot. (She puts her hood down.) Better.
(Gasps are heard. Anne turns to see all the townspeople staring at her agape by her appearance.)
Anne: Right. Sometimes I forget about the whole "I'm a freak in this world!!" thing.
(A tadpole starts crying)
Anne: Whoa, whoa. Don't cry. I'm not a monster. I'm just weird. See? (She wiggles her nose, then her ears and strikes a pose.) Ta-da! (winks)
Townsfolk: Ooh.
Tadpole: Mommy, Mommy! Give the freak money!
Mother: It was a lovely performance. (gives Anne some coppers) Here!
Tadpole: Do it again! Do it again!
(Anne looks back at the Plantars.)
Polly: (excited: gives a thumbs-up) Milk it!
Ooh.
Amazing.
Incredible.
Take my money. All of it.
This is so much better than that creepy oddities museum.
Anne: Oddities museum? What the heck is an oddity in Amphibia? Am I right?
(crickets chirping)
Anne: Stick to physical comedy. Got it. (She punches herself in the face.)
(all laughing)
Wow, Anne. You made a bucket of money! Literally! Whoo-hoo!
Now, how are we gonna spend all of this cay-esh?
Hmm.
Anne: Ooh. That oddity place is still open! How about it?
Hop Pop: Well, you made the money. But only if you keep your hood up. don't like you drawing so much attention to yourself.
Anne: Deal. Let's do it.
Polly: Uh, I think this place is closed! So let's leave and never come back!!
Are you kidding? Come on.
(all shuddering)
(chuckles) Guys, it's all fake! They're trying to scare you! Whoa.. Look at this hot mess! It's actually pretty lifelike!
Polly: Yeah, it even smells real.
The Curator: Hands off the merchandise!
(all screaming)
(The Curator screams as well, then starts laughing.)
The Curator: The ol' "mistaken for a grotesque lifeless being!" Works every time! Welcome to my Museum of Oddities. I go by many names, but you can call me "The Curator."
Polly: Little on the nose, but okay.
The Curator: And if you chuck some of that cash into this here sack, I'll give you a tour of the greatest museum these parts have to offer!
(Anne puts some coppers in the sack. The Curator takes a closer look at her.)
The Curator: Hmm. What's the matter, honey? Face too ugly for public? Ha!
Anne: Wouldn't you like to know.
The Curator: Oh. A mystery. I love it! But enough chitchat. Walk with me. I've traveled all over Amphibia, collecting its most rare and frightening creatures. Like the two-headed love dove. There's... I dunno, probably some kinda marriage allegory in there. Oh, and over here, the bugball playing praying mantis, Airbug! There's nothing in the rule book that says a mantis can't play bugball. I got the weirdest stuff right here. Feel free to look around. But keep in mind, breathing in the dust will be extra. (laughs)
(The Curator throws a smoke bomb on the ground, which explodes. As the smoke clears, he looks to have disappeared, but then he runs from behind a wax statue while panting.)
Polly: (gasps) Oh.
(The wax monster's eyes suddenly move. Polly screams and jumps into Hop Pop's arms.)
Polly: (groans) Its eyes! They're watching me!
Well, I had enough.
Yep, me too.
Anne, this place is freaking us out. We're gonna wait outside.
Okay, cool. See you guys later.
Oh, my gosh. Is that an old Skip Man? My parents had one of these! How did it get here?
Hey, Curator. How much is this Skip...
(The Curator suddenly appears.)
The Curator: Ah! The Skip Man. It can be yours... for a million coppers! (laughs)
Anne: Oh, come on, man. I can't afford that.
The Curator: Okay, fine. How about we trade for it then? Got anything rare or vomit-inducing I could display in exchange?
Anne: As a matter of fact, I do. (pulls back her hood)
The Curator: (lifts his eyepatch up) Sweet tadpole Mary!
Anne: That's right. I'm the ultimate oddity, baby! I'll make you a deal. I'll be your special attraction for one day only.
The Curator: Say no more, kid. One day of you in exchange for the Skip thing and everything I know about it. You got a deal.
Anne: Seriously? This is hu-yuge. You won't be disappointed, dude.
The Curator: I've already got some pretty elaborate plans for your exhibit. Come back tonight after closing time and we can discuss.
Anne: Elaborate, huh? I like the sound of that! See you later.
The Curator: Looks like we just hit paydirt, Frog Soos.
Frog Soos: Doo doo doo. Say, Mr. Ponds, do you get the feeling that we exist simultaneously in multiple parallel universes, completely unaware of the other's very existence?
The Curator: You've been licking yourself again, Frog Soos?
Frog Soos: (Chuckle) Caught me again, Mr.Ponds!
(Frog Soos licks his arm)
Anne: (squeals) You guys! You won't believe what I found in there. A Skip Man!
(all) Uh...
Anne: Trust me. It's big. And that Curator guy's gonna give it to me. All I have to do is be the museum's main attraction for a day.
No!
No!
Are you crazy?
Hop Pop: Anne, you cannot, by any means, do this.
Anne: But th-this is the first time I've found something from my world! It could explain so much.
Hop Pop: I understand that, Anne. But that Curator guy is... Well, just look at him!
The Curator: (chuckles)
Hop Pop: Tell you what, let's sleep on it, come back in the morning, and see if we can get some answers, okay?
Anne: Okay, you're right. I can wait. ..Until you fall asleep.
(all snoring)
(screams)
(sighs)
(laughs)
Anne: Curator! Yo! Curator!
Oh, there you are! That's not creepy at all!
The Curator: Welcome, welcome. So glad my little star is here! And every star needs a stage.
Anne: Whoa. Fancy! So about that Skip Man...
The Curator: Bup, bup, bup. All in good time, kid. You'll get what's coming to you.
Anne: Liking the sound of that!
The Curator: Say, why don't you stand up there? Soak it all in.
Anne: Whoa. Is this my mark? Should I hit it? I'm gonna hit it! Wha-bam!!
The Curator: (laughs) That's the stuff. Now, since you're my main attraction, I'm gonna let you in on this museum's biggest secret. You see, truth is nothing's fake. Everything here is real. Real and frozen in wax. Just like you!
(grunts, screams)
Anne: Ah, yep. Yeeep. This all tracks.
The Curator: I mean, it's crazy how easy that was! Honestly, I thought I was being way too obvious about it.
Anne: (groans) I can't believe this. I'm so stupid.
The Curator: Hey, hey. Don't talk about yourself like that! You're probably a very bright young lady who's just having a bad day.
Anne: Oh, thanks. That's actually a really nice thing to say.
The Curator: Hey. It's what I'm here for. So, as you've probably guessed, you're not just the main attraction tomorrow. You'll be here forever! (laughs)
(screams)
(snores)
(gags, spits)
Dang it, boy. Wait. Kids, where's Anne?
Oh, no. She went back to the museum.
We got to save her.
Back to the museum? At night?
You know what, I'll stay here and hold down the fort.
(Hop Pop) Oh, no, you don't. Come on.
Polly: Stop staring at me!
The Curator: (laughs) Um, uh, then it hits me. Artifacts. You can charge people when they break 'em. (munches) Win-win!
Anne: (groans) So boring.
The Curator: And Newtopia's got a ton of 'em. That's where I got that, uh, Skip guy you wanted.
Anne: Newtopia. Of course.
The Curator: Say, you want some of this canned meat? It's edible!
(rumbling)
The Curator: (grunts) That's what I get for going with a cheap machine. (grunts)
Hop Pop: Okay, boy. Here's the plan. First, I'll go in with a distraction. Then you come in behind...
The Curator: I think I got it. (grunts) Now we're cooking with gas, or whatever it is we frogs use.
Sprig: There's no time! Come on! (runs in screaming)
The Curator: Who are you? A cop? I ain't going back to frog prison!
Oh, no.
The Curator: Just a couple of common frogs. Ooh. I can stick 'em in the same mold. Call 'em the Two-headed Frog of Froglantis. (laughs) It's genius!
(both grunt)
Anne: Guys, get out of here! Save yourselves!
(both screaming) (laughing)
Polly: I knew it! Enjoy being mush, you wax demon!
(The monster roars.)
Polly: This is worse.
-(both groaning) -(growls)
The Curator: Looks like the end of the line for you two.
What the...
(growls)
The Curator: No! My beautiful creations!
Hop Pop: Kids, melt the rest of 'em, quick!
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo.
Shmebulock!
-(growls)
-(shrieks)
The Curator: Stay back, you filthy animals! You'll never catch me!
(The Curator tries to escape, but the creatures catch him.)
The Curator: You definitely caught me! Wait, wait! Hear me out! I'll cut you all in on the profits. 10%. Okay, 11%. 11.5%. I'm not coming to 12. So you might as well just...
-(screams)
-(growls)
(Red liquid leaking under the door)
The Curator: Calm down, everyone. It's just wax.
Sprig: Anne. Anne!
Hop Pop: Out of the way, kids!
Polly: She's frozen!
Hop Pop: Take her to go!
Anne: (sighs) I'll never get that Skip Man now.
Sprig: You mean this Skip Man?
Anne: No way! Dude, you're the best! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh. And the Curator said he got this from Newtopia. Which means we're on the right track.
Hop Pop: You know what else is on the right track? You keeping a low profile and not jumping into things without us.
Polly: I'm tired of facing my fears, Anne.
Anne: I know, I know. I shouldn't have gone off on my own. It was reckless. And besides, we work better as a team.
Hop Pop: (groans) Well, the important thing is, we're all okay. Except for that Curator. He's dead.
Sprig: Mm-hmm. Onward family! To Newtopia!
Anne: Hey, guys. Wanna see something cool? Did you know that this thing has a laser? Wha-bam!
(Hop Pop screams when the laser hits his eye.)
Bartley: I'm telling you, Branson, what we need is a direct frontal assault.
Branson: And I'm telling you, Bartley, a sneak attack is what's called for.
Blair: Yeah, well, you're both wrong. We need to learn how to communicate with our ant brethren and live in sweet, sweet harmony.
Ludicrous!
Yeah, shut up, Blair.
Blair: You shut up!
(The three start arguing; Marcy enters the tent.)
Marcy: 'Sup, triple B?
Ahem. Ah, Master Marcy. (To the Plantars) Are you lost?
Marcy: No, no. They're with me. The Plantars traveled here all the way from the valley.
(Sprig and Hop Pop each eat a fly while Polly hops onto the table and lets out a massive burp.)
Ah, welcome, dirty peasants.
Marcy: (gestures to her smiling friend) And this is my friend, Anne... (Anne pokes her cheek, which she holds.) Ow.
Anne: (laughs) Sorry. Just... still can't believe you're here. (She starts playfully patting Marcy's head like a drum.)
Marcy: (giggles) Anne, quit it.
Anne: All right, all right. Keep doing what you're doing.
You'll be glad to hear we've agreed on a battle strategy.
What? We've agreed on nothing!
Marcy: Well, no worries. I think I got it figured out. Anne, do you remember when we studied insect migration patterns in biology class?
Anne: Nope.
Marcy: Well, since the weather warmed up, those ants have been sending scouting parties deeper into our territory. In fact, I predict a full-scale invasion is just around the corner.
(As Marcy goes on, Anne gets distracted playing with the hood of Marcy's cloak.)
Marcy: The king has asked me to stop them before they turn Newtopia into a giant anthill. (To prove her point, she crushes the model of the cuty with a model of what said anthill will look like.)
Sprig: Wait. You work directly for the king of Amphibia?
Marcy: Uh-huh.
Hop Pop: Sprig, behave yourself.
Anne: I didn't even know you guys had a king.
Hop Pop: Well, duh. We're not anarchists, Anne.
Polly: Speak for yourself.
Marcy: Okay. Plan is we're gonna sneak behind enemy lines and drive the ant queen away. With her gone, the rest should retreat.
Sprig: Oh, yeah? And how are we doing that?
Marcy: Check it out!
Polly: (gasps) Boom shrooms?
Marcy: Not quite. These are stink shrooms!
Polly: (disappointed) Oh. Carry on.
Marcy: They're designed to release pheromones that should drive the queen away instantly. But we will have to fight our way through a bloodthirsty hoard of ants.
Polly: My interest has been restored.
Marcy: We'll have to be extra careful. If one thing goes wrong... (In leaning on the table, she nearly topples it) Whoa! (chuckles) Flimsy table.
Anne: Uh, Marbles, this sounds pretty dangerous. Yeah, why don't you leave the mission to me and the Plantars? We did stuff like this all the time in the valley. (grunts)
(Anne and the Plantars strike a pose.)
Hop Pop: To the max!
Marcy: Ugh. Come on, Anna Banana. I'll be fine.
Sprig: Banana?
Marcy: I've changed, remember?
Anne: Mm-hmm. Your cape's on fire again.
(Sure enough, it is. Marcy screams.)
Triple B: Fire! Fire! Fire! Somebody do something!
Anne: Hold still. (She removes the cape.) There! (Once it's on the ground, she stomps it out.)
Hop Pop: Those capes sure are flammable.
Marcy: Anne, trust me. I can handle this. Now let's get going. Mission, engage!
(Marcy runs off. Anne sighs then follows.)
Polly: What's your problem?
Hop Pop: Me? Well, to be honest, my cholesterol's been a little...
Polly: Not you. Frownzilla over there.
Sprig: Oh, come on, guys. Surely you don't trust this "Marcy" person.
Hop Pop: I do.
Polly: With my life, actually.
Hop Pop: I mean, look, Sprig, she's clearly harmless.
(He points outside where Marcy is studying her journal surrounded by butterflies. She notices them and giggles.)
Sprig: All right, yes, on the surface she looks harmless, but do you not remember Sasha?
Hop Pop: Eh, I try not to.
Polly: Now that you mention it...
Sprig: Well, I say we watch "Marbles" like a pigeon hawk. That way we can be ready if she tries to pull anything funny. You guys with me?
Polly: Still no.
Hop Pop: Can't say I agree, but you do your thing.
Sprig: (groans) Fine. Thanks for nothin'.
Hop Pop: You guys coming?
What, us?
(chuckles) Of course not. We're analysts.
We don't do... (snorts) ...field work.
Hop Pop: And what's wrong with field work? I'll have you know we farmers are the backbone of society! (ribbits)
Weirdos.
Marcy: Okay, we should be arriving there shortly! (screams)
Anne: Marcy!
Hop Pop: Well, down the hatch!
Sprig: All right, Bessie, we're about to be betrayed... probably. If we're not back in three hours, send for help.
(Bessie neighs and nibbles his head.)
Sprig: Good girl.
(Marcy grunts)
Marcy: All right! Let's go.
Anne: Hold up. Stay behind me.
Sprig: Behind, eh? Just where a maybe-backstabber would wanna be.
Anne: Okay, if we can just stay in this formation- Wait!
Marcy: This is gonna be a cinch, guys. Trust me, I know these tunnels better than anyone... (Screams as she falls down a hole: Anne catches her by the cape and pulls her up. chuckles and gives a thumbs-up) Thanks. Okay. Note to self: Do not step in holes.
Anne: Seriously, let us handle this. You'll be safer in the back.
Sprig: I gotta say, I do feel pretty safe back here. (grunts)
Everyone: Sprig!
Sprig: Why me? Ow! Why always me? (screams)
(ants shrieking)
Anne: All right, guys. Fight mode!
Hop Pop/Polly: On it!
Sprig: Yeah, on it!
Polly: Oh, Sprig, good. You survived.
Sprig: Yeah, I kicked him!
Anne: Okay, Marcy, stay close. (She sees Marcy wander off and blows a raspberry.)
Marcy: Ooh! Nice.
Anne: (grunts) Marcy, what are you doing?
Marcy: (chuckles) Essence of Heron's bane. Just what the doctor ordered.
(grunting)
Marcy: Steady, steady.
(screaming)
Marcy: Done! Guys, this way! (grunts) Come on! Insta-vines! Bred 'em myself.
Polly: Uh, guys? A little help here.
Marcy: Whoopsies!
Anne, Sprig, and Hop Pop: (gasp) Not the baby!
(grunting)
(grunts)
(roars)
Sprig: See? That could've been on purpose.
Polly: It was an honest mistake, Sprig.
Anne: Marcy!
Marcy: Oh, sorry, sorry. But it all turned out okay, right? Anyway, isn't vegetation in Amphibia just the coolest?
Hop Pop: You think vegetables are cool? Marcy, how'd you like to be adopted?
Sprig: Hmm.
Polly: Dude, seriously, chill.
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah, I got lots of vegetables back home.
Marcy: Wait. Shh! Get down! (the queen growls) It's the queen.
(spits, roars)
(purrs)
Sprig: Well, at least she's a good mother.
Marcy: Here's the plan. We're going to have to plant these around the room. That way she gets a nose-full. They're set to go off in five minutes, so move quickly. Also, the queen is nearly blind, but hears really well. So be very, very quiet.
(all grunt)
(crackling)
Anne: (gasps)
Marcy: (looks up) Huh? (grunts as Anne pushes her out of the way)
(queen growling)
(exhales)
Marcy: Anne, what are you doing?
Anne: Um, saving you from a giant rock that was about to crush you?
Marcy: Well, you didn't have to. I was about to get out of the way, myself.
Anne: No, you weren't. I have to protect you. Like I always do. Just like back home.
Marcy: But we're not back home, Anne. And I've been doing just fine by myself.
Anne: Yeah, but, but...
(crackling)
(squeaking)
Sprig: You gotta be kidding me.
(grunting)
(screaming)
(roars)
(roaring)
Anne/Hop Pop/Polly: Sprig!
Marcy: He's still alive! These bugs take a while to digest their food. Look!
(roars)
(gurgling)
Marcy: I can still save him.
Anne: No! I'll do it. You just... stay here.
Marcy: Anne, only I've studied barbari-ant biology. It has to be me.
Anne: No, it doesn't! I can handle it.
Marcy: Ugh! Why won't you just let me go?
Anne: (starting to cry, yells) Because I just got you back, okay? (Marcy looks surprised.) And I don't... (sniffs) I don't wanna lose you again.
(Marcy's look softens into a gentle smile: she grabs Anne's hands.)
Marcy: You won't. I promise.
Anne: (snorts) Okay... go. You got this.
Marcy: See you on the other side.
(ants shrieking)
Hop Pop: Who knew these ants were so bouncy?
Marcy: I did, 'cause I studied them.
Hop Pop: I can't watch.
Polly: Dibs on the crossbow.
Anne: Come on... Come on...
(Marcy punching, grunting)
(The Ant Queen vomits, and Marcy flies out sailing on a bone, carrying Sprig under her arm. Sprig looks up at Marcy, (whose eyes briefly flash green) and winks at him.)
Sprig: (whispers) Trustworthy. Whoo-hoo!
(all cheering)
Anne: She did it!
(Marcy screams)
Hop Pop, Polly: (screaming) Oh, no! I gotcha! I gotcha!
(all grunt)
(roars)
(gasping)
Uh, not looking forward to being torn apart right now!
Anne: Marcy, any ideas?
Marcy: Three, two, one...
-(clucks)
(ants shrieking)
(roars)
(rumbling)
(all coughing)
Sprig: Huh, you know what? It actually smells kinda nice.
Marcy: (holding her nose) I mean, it will liquefy your lungs if you breathe too much of it, so...
Sprig: Well, time to go!
Marcy: Hey. Thanks for having my back.
Anne: Not that you needed it. You're right. You really have changed.
Hop Pop, Polly: Uh, you're on fire again.
Marcy: What?
(Everyone skids to a halt: Marcy's cape really is on fire again somehow.)
Marcy: Oh, come on! (Starts stomping on her cape) There wasn't even any fire this time!
(Everyone makes it out. Marcy grunts as she faceplants.)
Marcy: Mission success!
Sprig: Hey, uh, Marcy? Sorry for all the suspicion earlier. I was wrong about you. You're no backstabber.
Marcy: Hey, I'm just glad you're okay. It's obvious you mean a lot to Anne.
(Sprig smiles then cringes as he starts gurgling. He pukes up some of the Ant Queen's stomach acid, which lands on and dissolves Hop Pop's shirt instantly.)
Hop Pop: Nyeh! Dang it, Sprig!
(The kids laugh.)
Hop Pop: Oh, ha-ha.
(bell tolling)
(musical fanfare plays)
Marcy: Now, come on. Who's ready to go to Newtopia? And write up a detailed report!
Sprig, Polly: Yeah!
Sprig: Wait, what?
Polly: A report? Boo!
Anne: Wow. Marcy hasn't just changed, she's flourished. I've never seen her so happy.
Hop Pop: Always impressive what people are capable of, isn't it? (grunting) A little help, please?
(all) Whoa!
Anne: Whoa, look at this place!
Hop Pop: Mighty impressive.
Sprig: (gasps) I want to touch everything!
Anne: This is like a city, city.
-Huh?
-What's going on?
I didn't do it!
(clears throat)
Marcy: Well met, Lady Olivia.
Olivia: The king sends his greetings, Marcy. He trusts you have succeeded?
(Marcy imitates trumpet fanfare as she tosses a barbari-ant head forward.)
Olivia: Ah, still fresh, I see. Excellent work. As expected of the great Marcy Wu. (snaps fingers)
Guard: Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
Olivia: I see you have... company.
Marcy: Lady Olivia... (squeals) Meet Anne, one of the friends I was telling you about. Turns out she got transported to Frog Valley.
Olivia: Uh-huh.
Marcy: A little town called Wartwood.
Olivia: It's a pleasure to meet you, Anne.
Anne: You too, dude! Oh, uh, I mean... milady.
Marcy: Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Anne: Oh, oh... And these are the Plantars.
Hey there! 'Sup.
-Hello. We can bow too.
-Your Highness.
-(Polly and Sprig grunt)
-Oh!
(guard snickers)
Olivia: Yes, well, uh... Welcome to Newtopia, Plantars and Anne. This is an old city, but one rich in history and splendor. Please don't touch anything that looks important.
Sprig: Hey, look what I did! (grunts) I'm okay! Statue's broken.
Olivia: Do enjoy your stay.
Hop Pop: She seems friendly... ish.
Anne: So, are you like a big deal here or something?
Marcy: Let's just say I have a perfect record when it comes to missions.
Sprig: Okay. So, Marcy, I've got a couple of questions. How'd you get so smart? What's your cloak made out of? What's in this pouch? Where'd you get that wrist thing? (whispers) What was Anne like back home?
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Kids, will you help me get the fwagon unloaded? Let's give Anne and Marcy some space.
(groans) Fine. (groans) Buzzkill.
Marcy: So, you haven't found a way home either, huh?
Anne: Nerp. You know, it's funny. I've been hoping to find you for so long, but now that I actually found you, I have no idea what to do next.
Marcy: (chuckles) I know what you mean. First things first though. We have to find Sasha.
Anne: Oh! Actually, I did find Sasha. We, uh... we had a fight.
Marcy: No... Was it bad?
Anne: Er... There were maybe some swords, minor explosions. Anyways, I don't know where she is now. (sighs)
Marcy: Well, even if we find a way home, it's pointless without Sasha.
Anne: So, what now?
Marcy: I don't know. Back home, Sasha always decided the plan.
Anne: (chuckles) Yeah. Maybe it's time we started making our own decisions, huh?
Marcy: Yeah! I mean, it's worked out for us so far, right? Come on, stand up!
Anne: Uh... okay. Come on, Anne. Let me see that power pose!
Anne: (inhales) This good?
Marcy: Good enough! (clears throat) I'm Marcy Wu!
Anne: And, uh, I'm Anne Boonchuy!
Anne, Marcy: And together, we're gonna find Sasha and find a way home! (grunting, laughing)
Marcy: Oh, my gosh. Okay, so I wanna know everything that's happened to you since you got here. You got any photos?
Anne: Do I? Here's me and Domino 2. She tried to eat us. Here's me and Sprig by the lake. There was a snake that tried to eat us. Oh, oh! Here's us running from a giant centipede that...
Marcy: Let me guess. Tried to eat you?
Anne: (gasps) How did you know?
(bell tolling)
King Andrias: The pieces are starting to fall into place. It's time for the game to begin.
 In Hora Prandii Est Newtopia! 
Marcy: Enjoy, everyone! This place makes the best beetle burger in all of Newtopia!
Polly: (munching) What's that?
Marcy: Oh, just my journal. I like jottin' down theories and observations. You know, all about indigenous fauna, medicinal techniques, customs and nuances of Amphibious species-based caste systems... (Polly zones out as she speaks.) Sometimes I even do drawings.
Polly: (gasps) It looks just like me.
Hop Pop: Wow! Anne, have you been keeping a journal too?
Anne: (sticks two straws up her nose)Look, guys! I'm a straw-lrus! Like a walrus, but with straws!
Sprig: (laughs) What's a walrus?
Server: Now, who should I give the bill to? (glances at Anne) Probably not you.
Marcy: (after drawing the "straw-lrus" in her journal) Oh! I'll take it! It's, oh, let me guess... 28 coppers?
Server: Right you are.
(all oohing)
Hop Pop: Wow! Can you do math like that too, Anne?
Anne: (exhales) Uh, you mean like with numbers and stuff?
Polly: Can you imagine if Marcy got stuck with us instead of Anne? We'd be set for life!
Hop Pop: Hush, Polly. Think those thoughts, don't say them.
Oh, yeah? Well... (screams)
Look out! (all scream)
Someone's trying to kill us!
No, no. It's fine. It's just a message from the king. Oh, correction. It's a puzzle-gram from the king.
(all) What?
He's basically hidden clues around the city and when I collect them all, I get a message. Ah! It's so fun!
Okay, this first symbol is a tree, so we should head towards Coral Park. Now come on, team. It's puzzle time!
A puzzle tour of Newtopia? Count me in!
(all cheering)
Come on, Polly! This may be our most exciting adventure yet!
Hey, thanks for coming in. Would you like to join our customer loyalty program? You can get free gifts.
Gifts? Free?
Oh, no.
Wow! Whoa! Look at that!
Anne. You're not marveling. Is everything okay?
Well, I don't know. It's just... Marcy's always been the smart one in our group. I've always just felt kinda dumb around her.
What?
Shh! She'll hear you.
Sorry. Well, hey. Maybe if you can solve the king's puzzle gram before Marcy, it'll prove you're just as smart as she is.
Hmm. Well, I did get us out of that puzzle dungeon that one time.
Yeah, you did!
Mission "Prove I'm not a dumdum," engage!
(grunts)
Here it is, guys. Coral Park!
(both) Whoa.
(thinking) Okay, you can do this.
So, one eye open and one closed.
Hmm... Ooh!
What if we aren't supposed to look at the trees?
What if we're supposed to listen to them?
I love it!
Hmm, but I was also thinking,
this statue of Ezra Brackish is looking through a telescope.
He's got one eye open and one eye closed, right?
Gotcha!
"Bring."
So that's the first part of the message.
Brilliant! (gasps)
(chuckles) Okay.
So the next clue is...
Oh! I recognize this.
Come on, gang. Let's motor!
Maybe you'll have better luck on the next one?
Yeah, I can do this!
Let's go get that next clue!
Whoop! Whoop!
(both) Whoo-hoo!
Goblin! Come on, girl!
Goblin, get down from there!
Don't worry. I got you.
(grunting)
(meows)
Thanks, lady. No worries.
I actually have one just like that back home. But with less legs.
(Sprig) Anne, come on! Whoop, gotta go!
Don't let that thing grow up.
Catch you later! (meows)
(all) Hmm.
Why the "W"? I mean, what's that supposed to mean?
Let me take this one, Mar-Mar. Okay.
Hmm.
(straining)
You'll never solve me!
Ah! I mean, oh... I see.
Hey, I gotta go to the bathroom! BRB!
Hey, can I see your crossbow arm? I don't see why not?
(panting) Okay...
Gotta find help. Um...
Aha!
An old person! Old people love puzzles.
Psst, hey. Wanna solve a puzzle?
Ooh! Looks like a juicy one.
Pull up some bench, dear.
The name's Doris. Anne.
Okay, any idea what this symbol has to do with the museum?
Oh! My son Harris used to work at the museum.
Oh, wait, no. Harris worked at the library.
Dusty worked at the museum. Or was it Dave?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. How many sons do you have?
Whoa.
Hmm.
I wonder if...
(screeches) (thuds)
(gasps) I knew this looked familiar!
The lines between the bricks of this west side wall of the museum
match up perfectly with the street grid of Newtopia.
Which puts us right about...
here!
"Me."
"Bring... me..."
(gasps) Only one clue left to go!
Well, if Dusty is upset about what Buster said, he should just tell him so.
Mmm-hmm. Hey, Anne.
So... Marcy figured out the second puzzle.
The puzzle! Sorry, Doris. Gotta run.
-It was nice talking to you. -You too, Anne.
Don't forget my offer to set you up with one of my sons.
Doris, stop it! (laughs)
Hey, Anne. Glad you could catch up.
Take a look at the final clue.
It's referring to the big bridge downtown. Come on!
Hop Pop, Polly! We're goin' to the bridge!
Take me with you!
Polly, look!
Just 987 more lunches, and we get a free suit of armor!
(groans)
Okay, Anne. One clue left.
Yeah, and Marcy'll probably solve it before we get there.
Oh, come on. So she's good at puzzles.
That doesn't mean she's smart and you're dumb.
Thanks, dude. Huh?
(gasps) Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know.
I made a few suggestions on how to increase the weight limit,
and they kinda, like, named it after me.
Now, come on! Let's see where this triangle fits in.
Okay, so she designed a bridge. That doesn't mean...
Please stop. Yeah, okay.
Why don't you go ahead? I think I need a moment alone.
Uh, okay.
Just holler if you need something.
(groans)
What? My trays! I got 'em!
(strains, grunts)
Thank you, sweetie!
Here, have some gnatchos on the house.
Thanks! My name's Anne, by the way.
I'm Gertie. Nice to meet ya.
(sighs)
Something got you down, Anne?
Have you ever had a friend who's so smart, they make you feel dumb?
Honey, this is Newtopia. Everyone here's a genius.
And then there's me, with my dumb old gnatcho cart.
What? Gertie, don't say that.
You're an independent businesswoman. You've got it goin' on!
(chuckles) Oh, aren't you a sweet one!
You wanna know my trick? Fake it till you make it.
If you act like you're smart, everyone assumes you are.
Really? That works?
Mm-hmm. I don't know the first thing about cooking, and look at me.
I'm a famous chef!
Well, I'm a chef.
Well, I'm in the food business.
(Sprig) Hey, Anne! Marcy and I are stumped. Get over here!
(Anne) All right. What do we got here?
Hmm. Okay.
Easy.
(thinking) Come on, Anne... fake it.
So, a triangle has three sides, right?
Three rhymes with, er... "tea."
You brew tea with water,
and there's water in, uh...
The sewer! Let's go down there.
Whoa! This sewer's shockingly clean.
There's actually a reason for that. I...
(both) Rehauled the sewer system?
How'd you know that?
Hey! Check that out.
That looks just like the circle in the clue.
Kinda. We obviously have to turn it.
(clanking)
(Marcy) Speak of the devil!
Here comes one of my improvements!
(alligator) Whoo-hoo. Ooh!
Would you guys believe that in addition to eating live meat...
Ooh!
...these babies love eating trash?
Go, go, go! Let's move!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo!
(panting)
(straining) Holy crud, that's heavy!
(Gertie) Gnatchos! Get your gnatchos!
Gertie? Is that you?
It's me, Anne. I need help!
Anne?
Don't worry, kiddo. I got ya!
(As Anne and Gertie struggle to open the sewer drain, with Sprig and Marcy waiting, the gator leaps up and tries to grab Marcy, but she dodges it as she yelps. Then, Gertie finally gets the drain open.)
Gertie: Got it! Here, grab my arm!
Anne: Come on, Mar Mar.
(Marcy grabs Anne's hand, but suddenly, she lowers down a bit.)
Marcy: Hey!
(The gator is shown to have grabbed Marcy's cape with his teeth. Then, Marcy quickly removes her cape, causing the gator to splash back down.)
Anne, you hang in there, you hear? Anne!
Did you say "Anne"? The tall, gangly creature?
-She saved my Goblin. We gotta help her! -(clanking)
Okay, they said they'd be at the bridge. Do you see 'em?
(Gertie) Hang in there, Anne!
-We'll save you, Anne! -(alligator roars)
Typical.
Ooh, looks like this is it!
Grab on! Hop Pop, now!
(roars)
Anne, what happened? Are you okay?
Can't you go ten minutes on your own
without getting into some kind of crazy danger?
Aw, give her a break, Hop Pop.
Anne's already sad because Marcy's so smart she makes her feel dumb.
Sprig! What?
Anne, is that true?
I don't know. Maybe?
I guess I get a little jealous of you sometimes.
I mean, you're so smart, and I'm... not.
Anne, that's insane.
Besides, I'm jealous of you.
Huh? What for?
Yeah, what for?
You get along with people so well.
Three people you met today
just risked their lives to save you.
(meows)
Heck, the Plantars here adopted you and would do anything for you.
Yeah, sure, I'm good at solving puzzles and calculating the check, but you're amazing at making connections. (looks away blushing shyly) Me, I have trouble looking people in the eye sometimes.
Thanks, Marcy. Maybe that's why we make such a good team. Come here, you.
Aw!
Hey, anyone else want a snack?
That nice lady gave me some gnatchos.
Whoa! Wait a sec, it's... Look!
The symbol... it's a gnatcho!
Sprig, empty that tray!
(all gasp)
(Marcy) That means the message is...
"Bring me the Plantars."
Oh, guys, we've been summoned!
And you solved the puzzle gram, Anne!
Self-esteem boost and an audience with the ruler of this world? Win-win, baby!
(all cheering)
So... you guys wanna feed gnatchos to that alligator?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
(munches) Ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Just look how happy it makes him.
Anne: Dang, girl. This is where you've been hanging out this whole time?
Marcy: I wouldn't say I "hang out" here, but yes! Staying at the castle has been awesome!
Wow, I can't believe we're here!
And that we're about to meet the king of Amphibia.
Hop Pop: Wow, just look at this place. Am I dressed okay? Should I have worn my silk ascot? I'll go back and get it.
Marcy: Hey, hey. Don't stress, guys. This is no big deal.
Lady Olivia: Okay, frog family. You're about to meet King Andrias. This is a big deal.
(all gulp)
(angelic voices singing)
All: Wow!
Olivia: May I present to you Andrias Leviathan, Lord of Amphibia. Peacekeeper of a thousand years and the first of his name.
Anne: Now that's king-sized.
King Andrias: Hello, Plantar family!
-(all gasp)
King Andrias: (laughing) Oh, bring it in, you guys. Bring it in.
Hop Pop: Quick, kids, bow. (grunts)
King Andrias: It's so good to finally meet you!
(all grunt)
Polly: I love this guy!
King Andrias: (laughing)
Olivia: Dear King Andrias, just once, it would be nice if you followed proper castle etiquette.
King Andrias: (blows raspberry) Oh, etiquette smetiquette! Ooh! And what do we have here?
Anne: (nervously) Hey.
King Andrias: You must be Anne. 'Sup? (to Marcy) Um, am I saying it right? 'Sup?
Marcy: (gives a thumbs up) You got it!
King Andrias: (laughs) The thumb of approval. And here's a thumb for you, Anne.
Anne: Oh, uh... right back at ya. (gives him a fist bump)
King Andrias: (chuckles, then laughs exuberantly) Delightful!
Anne: (grunts)
King Andrias: But now, let's get down to business, shall we? Getting you girls back home, safe and sound. Hmm... Alas, without the music box, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. Marcy doesn't have it, and, well, I assume you don't have it either.
Anne: Oh! Uh, actually, I do have the box.
Marcy: What? Are you serious?
King Andrias: Why, this is marvelous news! Come, come, let's see it.
Anne: Well, I don't "have it, have it." Hop Pop left it with some contacts to see what they could learn about it.
Hop Pop: (chuckles nervously)
Anne: But I do have a photo of it.
King Andrias: Yes, yes, a photo... (chuckles) Let's see here. Hmm, how peculiar. Marcy, didn't you say the gems were colored? Look here. They're... They're gray.
Anne: Hey, you're right. I never actually noticed that.
King Andrias: This will require further study in the deepest of our archives. Give me a few days to work with this information. At that time, we shall reconvene and set a glorious plan in motion.
Anne: Great! Mar Mar, what can I do to help?
Marcy: Can you translate ancient Amphibian runes?
Anne: I sure... can't!
Marcy: (chuckles) Don't worry, dude. I got this.
Anne: Nice! Just like group projects back home.
King Andrias: Until then, my dear Plantars, go forth and enjoy the sights of Newtopia. We've booked you a suite at the Hemisphere Hotel, my treat. And here... pick a hand!
Anne: Hmm.
King Andrias: (clears throat)
Anne: This hand?
King Andrias: Psych! (laughing) But wait, what's this? The Royal Credit Card! It will grant you access to do anything in Newtopia. Be safe with this now. Wars have been waged for less.
Sprig: Whoa, ho, ho, ho! We get to explore Newtopia with unlimited money?! This is a dream come true! Onward, family! Time to see Newtopia!
What do you mean, nobody wants to see Newtopia?
Not happenin'.
Polly happy right here.
Anne, come on. You're with me, right?
Sorry, dude.
The only thing I want to explore is that gift basket.
(straining)
(grunts) Maybe later.
But we have the Royal Credit Card!
The city's our playground.
Sprig, the city will still be there tomorrow.
Probably.
Tomorrow?
Or... I could take the card and...
Hop Pop: Sprig Plantar! Under no circumstances are you to take that card outside of this hotel!
Sprig: (sighs) I won't, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Good! (snoring)
(snoring) (snoring)
Sprig: Hmm... (A lamp turns on behind him.)
Sprig: He didn't say anything about using it inside the hotel. (chuckles) Huh?
Bella: Four years of Newtopia University and a mountain of student debt for this?
Oh, hi there. Bella the bellhop, at your service.
Got the rest of your bags here.
(exhales)
(clears throat) How about a tip?
Oh, sure! If you were to do one thing in the hotel for fun,
what would it be?
Well, I've never gone, but everyone says
the view from the top of the indoor Ferris wheel will change your life.
Sprig: Great. Thanks for the tip.
(grumbles)
(elevator dings)
Whoa... (gasps)
This place is amazing!
Look at that fountain!
And ooh! That must be the indoor Ferris wheel.
I'm gonna save you for later.
Excuse me. Are you winking at that Ferris wheel?
Sprig: Yes, and I'm rich, so deal with it. Ha ha!
Very good, sir.
Sprig: One ant cream sundae, my good man.
Whoa.
Napkin, sir?
Sprig: What do I look like, a slob?
Looking good!
(chuckles, grunts)
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Nope.
Nope.
(panting) Yes!
Thank you, my good man.
And now, to put on my hat.
(gasps, sobs)
Care for some Bug-accino, sir? Made fresh daily.
Sprig: Five, please!
Um, these are pretty strong.
Sprig: Five, I say!
Bop, bop, bee bop.
Wow.
(gulps)
Blah! Disgusting!
Sprig: But maybe Hop Pop will like it. One to go, please. And she said they were strong. I don't feel a thing.
(buzzing) Huh?
(low-pitched buzzing)
Sprig: (in deep voice) I'm the time lord now.
(laughs, grunts)
(babbling)
I'll have what he's having.
Well, all that's left is to ride the Ferris wheel,
and I have just the thing to pay for it.
Huh?
No! The Royal Credit Card!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
(elevator dings)
Excuse me, youngster. Could you push the 19th floor?
Uh, sure.
(elevator dings)
Oh, shoot. Can we try the 18th?
Yeah-huh.
(elevator dings)
Here we go, 18th floor.
Nope. This isn't the casino either.
Looks like we'll have to go to every floor until we find the right one.
It may take hours, but what do we care?
We're old and have all the time in the world.
(both laugh)
(elevator dings)
(grunts)
(grunting)
Concierge: Five minutes left on your break, Bella.
Bella: (sighs) Is this it? Is this the rest of my life? Oh, well. If the real world's taught me anything, it's that magic is dead and miracles don't exist.
(Sprig yelps)
Sprig: Oh, thank goodness. I was beginning to think I'd never get my Royal Credit Card with unlimited funds back.
Bella: Did you say, "unlimited funds"?
Sprig: Sure did! Oh, you're gonna steal it, aren't you?
Bella: Finders keepers!
Sprig: Hey!
(panting)
Sprig: Oh, no, you don't!
(grunts, gasps)
Sprig: Well, Ferris wheel. The time has come.
Bella: Are you winking at that Ferris wheel?
Sprig: Yes, and I'm rich, so deal with it!
Bella: Hey, get back here!
-Ha ha! (blows raspberry) -(grumbles)
(sighs) Glad I'm a frog right about now.
Hey, no fair! I'm just a frog!
(grunts) Hey!
Give me that! It's mine!
(both grumble)
(both gasp)
(both) Ooh!
(both) Ah!
Whoa, it's spectacular.
It's even more amazing than everyone says.
(sighs) Sorry about trying to steal your card, kid.
I shouldn't have. I... just...
I just really need the money.
Sprig: Oh, that's okay. (gasps)
Bella: (screaming)
Sprig: (yelps) I'll never get to her in time. Unless... (gulps) Ah!
(screaming)
(screaming)
(squealing)
(gasps)
Huh?
(shouts, grunts)
Bella: What the... You saved me! Thanks, kid.
Concierge: You two are in big trouble! Nobody rides the Hemisphere Ferris wheel for free!
Sprig: Oh, sure. Here you go!
Concierge: (gasps) My mistake, sir! (to Bella) You, on the other hand, are fired!
Bella: (groans)
Sprig: Excuse me. Were you about to fire your best employee?
Concierge: My best?
Sprig: This bellhop recommended the Ferris wheel, but also went above and beyond her duty by showing it to me personally. I think the Newt King, who I happen to know, would be upset if she didn't get a raise!
Concierge: The king? Uh, yes, absolutely. Sound good, Bella?
Bella: Yes, sir!
Bella: Thanks, kid. It's people like you that make me ever so slightly more positive about the future.
Sprig: Don't mention it! Wanna go buy, like, 500 ant sundaes?
Bella: If you're paying, let's make it 1,000.
(yawns)
(groans)
Sprig: (grunts) What a morning!
(alarm beeps)
(all yawn)
Hop Pop: Nothing like a nap to feel rejuvenated and full of energy.
You guys wanna check out the hotel?
Rise and shine, Sprig! Let's go, little buddy!
Time for more crazy hijinks!
Sprig: (groans) Go away.
Hop Pop: Come on, boy. I want to get my adventure on!
Polly: Milk that credit card!
Anne: I hear there's a Ferris wheel!
(Outside Newtopia, seagulls fly away as a robot waves its arms. We cut to Newtopia where Anne and the Plantars are on a tour bus.)
Tour Guide: (On the speakers) Welcome, ladies and gentle-phibians, to a safe uneventful afternoon of touristy nonsense. It may not be as eventful as other tours but did I mention it's safe?
Anne: This is the last time we let Hop Pop pick the activity.
Hop Pop: Look Anne, we've got a few days to kill before King Andrias reveals his findings about the music box. And what better way to spend that time than learning? (Anne, Sprig, and Polly groan. Anne then sees various food outside.)
Anne: Oh, wow, what's that place?
Tour Guide: Imminent danger. Look away!
Polly: But imminent is the best kind of danger.
Tour Guide: Now then, what's the most important thing to do when visiting Newtopia? Any guesses?
Anne: Ooh, ooh! Eating like a local? Looking like a local? Partying with the locals?
Tour Guide: Nope. It's getting to know the city from a safe distance. Like on this bus.
Hop Pop: Such wisdom. (Anne and Polly sigh.)
Anne: This is just like when I'd go traveling with my mom.
(We go to a flashback where Anne and her mother are in Thailand. She sees people lining up to get Thai food.)
Young Anne: Mom, can I please try some of that?
Mrs. Boonchuy: No, sweetie, your California stomach can't handle it. But you can have carrot stick and trail mix. (Young Anne whimpers in sadness and we go back to the present.)
Anne: I didn't want the baby carrots, Mom! I didn't want 'em! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! (A driver rolls up their window as she cries.) You know what?
Polly: What?
Anne: This time, I'm gonna experience the city the way the locals do! Not sit on a bus like some dumb tourist!
Tour Guide: And now for our tour of the tour bus. This is the ceiling, what a good ceiling! Not to be outdone by the floor!
Male Newt: Ooh!
Polly: Count me in. So what do we do?
Anne: Follow my lead. (groans) Oh, man, Hop Pop, my stomach is killing me. Can we go back to the hotel?
Polly: Uh, me too. I need to get off now or I'll explode! (The other passengers gasp.)
Hop Pop: (gasps) Why does this keep happening? Now I'll never make it to the cheese museum.
Anne: No, no! Why don't you stay on the tour? We can head back ourselves.
Hop Pop: And we're back. But you two gotta promise me you'll go straight to the hotel. No detours!
Anne and Polly: We promise!
Anne: Sprig, you coming?
Sprig: I thought you'd never ask. (He tries to leave, but sees that he is handcuffed to Hop Pop.) You handcuffed us together?!
Hop Pop: Sorry, Sprig, but after the Ruins of Disaster incident, you've left me no choice.
Sprig: Well, the jokes on you. Anne and Polly would never leave me. (He sees Anne and Polly getting off the bus.)
Anne: Later, dude!
Sprig: (Trying to free himself) No! No, no, no, no, no!
Hop Pop: Now sit your butt down and put on your cheese hat. (He puts a cheese hat on Sprig.)
Sprig: Noooooooo! (The bus takes off.)
Anne and Polly: Ah.
Anne: Welcome, Polly, to the bowels of the city.
(chattering)
Polly: You know, it's been a long time since you and I had a solo adventure.
Heck, yeah! We're way overdue. Looks like it's finally time for team P'Anne to get more screen time.
(together) Team P'Anne for life!
Anne: Ow!
(Polly groans)
Our team name's bad.
Yeah, it could be better. Anyhoo, let's get this authentic experience started.
-Okay, sounds good. Oh! -No guides!
People will know we're lame-o tourists.
(gasps) You're right. Don't wanna be like that guy.
Aw.
All right. Step one, eat like the locals. Street food, baby. Nothing more authentic. Hey, buddy. Can you whip us up a couple of... Uh... Uh... Actually, we'll just take two of whatever the locals eat.
Uh, are you sure? I mean, we don't usually serve this to outsiders.
It's pretty spicy.
Ha! That don't scare me. After all, I'm Thai.
Uh, Jerry. All right. Whatever. Two extra spicys. Here you go.
-All right! Cheers! -Cheers!
Hey, not bad! (groans, pants)
(coughs, screams)
(gulps)
(laughs) Weak!
(all gasp)
-(panting) -Hey! You two torched my roof.
Prove it!
Sorry, my good man... Eh, newt. This should cover the cost.
(sighs) Didn't you read the sign? Cash only!
Anne: Uh... (chuckles) Well, of course I did... Run, Polly!
Hey!
(Polly screams) Could you not throw me?
I panicked! I panicked!
Get back here!
Just wait till I get my hands on you.
Whew! That was close.
Man, Polly, I feel so authentic. I can't feel my face but my heart feels alive.
Did you see the part where I breathed fire? What's next? What's next?
Step two, look like the locals. What's the one thing they've got that we don't?
-Cash money.
Tails! Big, beautiful newt tails.
Polly: Well, actually, I have a tail but I see what you're doing.
-Tails. Tails. Tails. -Tails. Tails.
-Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. -Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails.
-(Anne, Polly) Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. -Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails.
-Tails. Tails. Tails. -Tails. Tails. Tails.
Two tails, please, for two locals.
Locals, hey? Well, nice to meet ya.
Whoa, uh... Am I supposed to, uh...
Now let's get you fixed with a temporary tail until your new one grows back.
Gross. And okay!
Hmm. Exactly how long was your old tail?
How long you got?
-All right! Now that's what I'm talking about. -Ow!
Hey, Polly! Find one you like?
Give me that one.
This is it, Polly. You have a tail, I have a tail. We totally look like the locals.
Yeah, we're definitely blending in. (laughs)
Oh, hey, what's that stand over there selling?
(screams) Oh, my Gosh.
-(screams) My glasses! -Ah, sorry!
All right, all right, what seems to be the problem?
-(Anne) Ooh! I'm so sorry. -(grunts) Wha... (grunts)
I oughta lock you up for disturbing the peace.
You ought to, but you won't, right?
Oh. Smart one, hey? That's it! You're coming with me.
-(screams) -(yells)
(screams, blows whistle)
(groans)
Dang it! We'll never find them in this crowd.
What? Sure we will.
Shush. I'm lazy.
Ah.
(sighs) That was intense.
Being authentic is more work than I thought.
I don't know. Seems pretty cool to me. What's next?
-(marching band playing) -(crowd cheering)
-Look at that sweetie. -Ooh.
Step three, baby. Party with the locals.
(both) Whoo-hoo!
Hey, can I join in?
I don't see why not.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Go, Anne! You maniac!
Oh, hey! Mouth control.
-What? -(mimicking) Hi, Polly. I'm Freddie the Fish. Fry me up for dinner.
-(Anne mimicking laugh) -(laughs)
-Wait, something's wrong. -I'm delicious. (laughs)
-(crowd gasps) -Huh?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just dancing with your goofy mascot.
(crowd gasps)
That "goofy mascot" is Igor the Brave. He's a great hero who once gave his life to save Newtopia. This parade is in his honor.
My bad. I had no idea. Whoa!
(crowd gasps, clamors)
We should run, right?
-Heck, yeah! -After them!
Hey, it's those two kids. At least one of them's a kid. The other one is some kind of funny-looking...
Just chase us already!
You got it!
(Anne panting)
You've got to be kidding me.
Spicy wraps here. Get your spicy wraps. Hey, it's you two! Get back here. (grunts) Siege mode!
(yells)
Holy... (screams)
Anne: Forget authenticity. Forget being a local. We should've used a brochure. A guide. Anything! Heck, we should've never left the tour bus. (screams)
Hop Pop: (screams) Street freaks! Oh, wait. No, it's just my granddaughter and my adopted granddaughter.
(crowd approaching)
-(both) Let us in! Let us in! -Everyone, remain calm.
As long as we don't open the doors or windows, this disaster will pass us by.
-Forget that! -(Anne screams)
-(Polly screams) -Quick, get in!
(all scream)
-Oh, no, you don't. -(Anne strains)
(Anne strains, screams) This is insane! Leave me!
Never! Team P'Anne for life, remember?
That's right. That's right. P'Anne can't lose.
(gasps) I just thought of a better name. An-olly.
Oh, that's not better.
It's worse, actually.
(sobs) "An-olly." I... I love it. Now let's end this thing.
Don't make this harder than it has to... (groans)
Kick in the neck! Yoink!
Oh, boy.
(crowd screams)
(burps)
Whoo!
You guys still want to check out that cheese museum?
(all) Yes, please!
Marcy: (groans) This is the last book and still nothing on the music box.
King Andrias: Well, even I have to admit I'm surprised. This is one of the most comprehensive libraries in all of Amphibia. Maybe we missed a book somewhere.
Marcy: (groans) I need more bug-accinos. B-R-B. Whoa! Ah, dang it! Tell me that tapestry wasn't hundreds of years old.
King Andrias: Oh, way older than that actually.
Marcy: No!
King Andrias: But wait! Marcy, look!
Marcy: Hmm. I'ma push it. Bop.
King Andrias: What the... Huh?
Marcy: No way. A secret library wing. Did you know about this?
King Andrias: No. It must be thousands of years old, judging by the smell. Whew!
Marcy: Well, come on. I just know the answers are down there waiting for us.
(birds squawking)
(sighs) City walking is great. But I could use a little sitty-sitting. Let's stop at this park for a bit. Works for me. Sprig, Polly, you guys want to toss the old frisbeetle around?
-(bell tolls)
-(gasps)
(rowers grunt)
(fencing newt) En garde.
(band playing)
Kids, this ain't no park. This is Newtopia University.
Oh, man. College is the best. According to movies back home, you can do crazy things and be horribly irresponsible with no consequences.
Hop Pop: I can't believe we're actually here. No Plantar has ever gone to Newtopia University. And it's my dream that one day, far, far from now, one of you two will attend.
-Huh? -(chuckles) Sorry, Hop Pop. I don't think that either of us is cut out for this. Especially Sprig.
What? What you talking about?
You don't have the attention span.
Ha! That's ridiculo...
Sprig, go long!
Okay!
Now, how does one escape from a mountain mantis?
-Yes, Parsifal.
-First, we must calculate the probability of escape by average number of mantises per capita.
Divided by the average body weight of those fleeing for their lives.
Whoa, whoa, guys. All you gotta do is tickle it behind its hind legs with a willow branch. You'll escape no problem.
That's correct.
Sprig, catch.
(all) Ooh.
My, my, my, my, my. Aren't you a precocious young frog? Resourceful, survival-savvy, athletic. Any other hidden talents?
Hmm. I can do funny things with my arm.
(screams)
Uh, anything else?
-I play the fiddle.
-Show me.
-(student) Ooh. -Oh, yes. Good.
Sprig, what did you break? What did he break?
Oh, no, nothing, nothing. I'm Professor Herringbone. Headmaster here at Newtopia University.
Oh, well, uh, I'm Hopediah Plantar. Big fan of your school. I hope one day far, far in the future one of my grandchildren will attend your fine institution.
Well, what if that one day is today?
Huh?
We have a program for young, promising students of the future! And I think Sprig here is a perfect fit!
-Huh?
We could do a trial stay for Sprig tonight.
And if it all goes well, he can start with us next semester.
Seems reasonable. Isn't this great, Hop Pop? It's just what you wanted.
Hmm. Well, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Then it's agreed. Sprig Plantar, your trial begins immediately. Welcome to the university.
All right! Hop Pop, your dream is coming true. And don't worry. I won't let you down.
Hey, you gonna throw that bug-disc back or what?
Guess what, Anne? I'm going to college.
Cool. Wait, what?
-(Sprig grunts)
Now, there are a couple of school rules you'll need to get adjusted to.
(grunts) If I can handle a mountain mantis, I can totally handle this.
That's the spirit. Enjoy your first class, my boy.
(grunts, groans)
At Newtopia Prep, we do not bound around heedlessly.
Oh, uh, yes, of course.
-(Sprig grunts) -We also tuck in our shirts. And straighten our ties. And we absolutely do not wear hats.
(screams, sighs)
(professor clears throat)
Hey, hi, how's it going?
All right, class. Let us begin with concept of...
Hmm? Hmm? Uh, I mean, we all wanted to do that, right?
Mr. Plantar, hand over that contraption this instant.
(sighs)
Now, back to the lesson.
I can do this. I can do this. I can do this for Hop Pop.
(screams)
(screams)
(sighs) Just look at how happy he is. They grow up so fast. (gasps) Sprig's tadpole tail. I remember when it fell off. It's so cute.
(Bessie purrs)
-(explosion) -(students screaming)
Rodney Mcdonald, for the last time, get that cow out of the lecture hall.
Eat my shorts, prof!
-(cow moos) -(professor screams)
-(Anne chuckles)
Sprig gets to do all that. (groans) Jelly!
Yeah. They're probably having crazy cool parties and slapping farm animals right now. Just over that wall. (sighs)
Hey, Anne, how good at climbing are you?
Oh. I'm picking up what you're putting down.
(both chuckle)
Will you two keep it down? I'm trying to cry up here.
(both) Sorry, Hop Pop.
-I got extra homework. -(gasps) Lucky.
(groans)
(sighs)
Mr. Plantar, could I have a word?
Oh. Hi, Professor. So you've heard, huh?
Yes. I've spoken with your professors.
(sighs) And they all think I'm a terrible student. I get it. I'll leave.
"Leave"? Oh, no, no, no, no. It's true, your energy can be a bit disruptive, but it's a good disruption.
-Huh? -And, since this is going to be such a project, we are starting early. No waiting for next semester. (chuckles) No, no, no, no. Tomorrow, you officially start as a student of Newtopia University.
-What? -With extra classes and extra work, oh, we will shape you into something amazing.
"Extra work"? "Extra classes"?
Now, sleep well. Because at dawn, the real work begins. (chuckles) Oh, your family is going to be so proud.
Nope! Nope, nope, nope, nope. Sorry, Hop Pop. But I can't be here another ding-dang second. I'm leaving tonight. -(school bell rings)
Hmm?
(PA: man) All right, students, doors locking in three, two, one.
No!
I'm locked in.
I'm... I'm a prisoner.
What's that?
Now why would a school need all this security?
Unless... (gasps) This ain't a school at all.
Maybe they're frog-nappers and this whole thing
was just an elaborate scheme to steal Sprig's beautiful pink skin?
Hang on, Sprig, I'm a-comin'.
(grunts, strains)
Guess I gotta cut back on those bug burgers.
Hang in there, Sprig!
(strains) Got it!
(both giggling)
-(sighs) -(grunts)
Ready for the time of your life?
Bring it.
Uh, I think I just killed somebody.
(alarm blares)
-Oh, shoot. -Make a break for it!
(strains)
(guard) A security breach! Hit the lights!
(screams)
(grunting)
-Nailed it! -Hey, did you just hear someone yell, "Nailed it"?
Release the weevils!
-(weevils growl, bark) -"Weevils"?
-(weevils bark) -(screams)
Hey, do you hear dogs?
Depends. What's a dog?
(Sprig screaming)
Is that Sprig?
Hey, Sprig, where the party at, man?
-Can't talk. Running. -(barking)
-(barking stops) -(weevils growl)
Oh, boy. Run!
This is my fault for looking like such a snack.
-(strains, sighs) -(alarm blaring)
(pants) Hop Pop, what are you doing?
Coming to save you.
Hang on. (grunts)
-(strains) -All right, hold it right there.
Sprig and Mr. Plantar? What's going on?
You're not frog-napping my boy.
You were trying to make me a prisoner.
I'm sorry, frog-nap? "Prisoner"?
Sprig isn't locked up. He can leave whenever he likes.
Then what's with all the gate locking? The alarms, the guards?
That's for the students' safety. We are in the city, after all.
There are some dangerous oddballs out there.
Hey, Professor, we found these two dangerous oddballs trying to sneak into the university.
You can torture me all you want. I'll never talk.
-Polly? Anne? -(sighs)
We were just looking for a rad college party.
And I was trying to escape.
Sorry, Hop Pop, but I hate this place.
It's boring and stuffy, and they don't let you wear hats.
I know it's your dream. I'm sorry I couldn't make it come true.
"Dream"? "Dream"?
Forget the ding-dang dream. (strains, grunts)
I ain't ready to let you go yet. Heck, I ain't letting you go ever!
It's homeschooling for the rest of your life.
Forget higher learning, or big opportunities.
You belong at the bottom of the socioeconomic barrel with me.
Yay! Wait, is this a good thing? Oh, what the heck. Yay!
My boy, you continue to impress.
No one has ever evaded campus security before.
The offer of admission still stands.
Thanks, Professor, but I don't think it's for me right now.
In a couple of years, who knows?
Well, we'll be here waiting for you when you're ready.
Now, come on, everyone, let's get back to that crazy party.
(gasps) I knew it.
-(weevils bark) -(Anne, Polly scream)
Happy you're back, Sprig.
Me too, Hop Pop.
-Hey, Sprig, go long! -Okay!
(chuckles) Yeah!
Baskins: "There I was, about to split the case of the century wide open. The person behind it all was right behind this chair, and it was my job to deliver justice with my fists."
Polly/Sprig: Ooh!
Hop Pop: Whoa.
Anne: Aren't these old detective films the greatest? It's like a normal movie, but no one talks out loud and everybody loses in the end.
Hop Pop: I love it. Just a hard-boiled guy tryin' to right wrongs, without any of that fancy color nonsense getting in the way.
Anne: Hop Pop, shouldn't you be focusing on driving?
-(honking)
-(brakes squealing)
-Hop Pop: All right, kids. We're here.
-Anne, Polly, and Sprig: An arcade?
-Anne: Totally worth it.
-Polly: You're the best Hop Pop who ever hopped.
Hop Pop: What? No, no, no. We're going there.
Anne: Boo!
Polly and Sprig: Aw, Hop Pop.
(all) Ow.
Hop Pop: Shush, youngsters. Have a little respect. This is Sal's. Sal was like a brother to me. We've been friends since the old ways were just "the ways." He was so good at making sandwiches, he decided to relocate to Newtopia to make the "buko dolares." Oh, kids, how I've dreamed of those sandwiches. That lightly toasted bread, the fresh green lettuce, the thin yet supple slices of roast beetle, and finally... the sauce. Tangy, zippy, and just plain amazing. Oh, lordy!!
Anne: Whoa. Sounds like that you really need to be alone with this sandwich, HP.
Sprig: (Iaughs) Zing!
Hop Pop: Hush. I promised myself if I ever made it to Newtopia, I'd swing by for one of those sweet, sweet sandies. Now, come on, gang, who's ready to revisit the glory days?
Sprig: Hop Pop, this looks really important to you. And the three of us would never want to get in the way of something so person...
Hop Pop: You wanna go to the arcade, don't ya?
(all) Yes, please.
Hop Pop: Fine. Play your newfangled games. But it's that attitude that's causing tradition to be left in the dust... (coughs, sighs) Guess what, Sal? It's your old pal Hop... (gasps) What the... Wha... What happened here?! Sal? Sal?! (strains) Sal's trademark fedora. But he never went anywhere without it. (thinking) Sal would never leave his shop unattended. Something happened here, something bad.
(light buzzes)
This was foul play, and it was my job to get to the bottom of it. I just wish I had some kind of clue. What's this? Blood? No, sauce. People were always asking Sal for his secret recipe. Offered to pay big. But he said family tradition was more important than a few copper coins. (chuckles) My kinda frog, who made my kind of sauce.
(smacks lips)
Hmm. Newtropolitan Gala, tonight 8:00 p.m.
"Get the sauce!!"?
Looks like someone got tired of askin and took his recipe by force. Now all I had to do was follow the sauce to find Sal. Follow the sauce. Find Sal. You don't have to repeat me. Sorry, sorry. *chuckles*"
-Anne: Man, this is a long line.
-Sprig: Maybe it'll go quickly.
-Polly: Kill me.
- Anne: (groans, gasps) "Did y'all see that? We just got cut."
- Sprig: "Eh, what are ya gonna do?"
- Polly: Not like it makes a difference at this point.
-Anne: "Are you kidding? We have to say something."
-Sprig: "I don't know, Anne. Isn't it just better to let this one go?"
-Polly: "Yeah, Anne. He's beneath us."
Guys, this isn't just about cutting. This is about justice, doing the right thing. And... Huh? Was that Hop Pop in a tuxedo?
(both) Huh.
(jazz music playing)
(chattering, laughing)
Ooh, good heavens.
 I haven't had a bite Since a quarter to three 
 Now I'm thinking Something's gonna take A bite outta me... 
You guys should buy bug coin.
And then I said, "That's what boot straps are for."
 ...man said You can't have it all 
Oh. We don't see many frogs at the Newtropolitan. You must be quite wealthy. What do you do?
I'm a farmer. No! Farmerceutical executive. Nice save.
Canape? The sauce is to die for.
-(echoes) ...die for... -(gasps)
Sal's sauce, and not on a sandwich. He never would have stood for this. One thing was for sure, Sal was in trouble and needed my help.
(clears throat) Say there, sonny.
Would you mind doing a gentleman a favor?
Anything, sir.
Hoo boy! Gonna need another round with extra sauce.
Say, where do we get that sauce again?
Frog cannot be here. Move.
Why? 'Fraid of what I might find?
(grunts)
(gasps)
There. Is health violation.
Oh, okay.
So, any chance you could direct me to your supplier?
There he is! That's the guy who stole my clothes and my tray.
You're gonna have to come with me, sir.
Okay, okay. Don't want any... trouble!
-(Hop Pop) Yah! -(groans)
Ha! Take that, you...
(chokes, wheezes)
(groans, sighs)
Looks like I hit a dead end. Without a source on the sauce, or even an address, I was out of luck.
-Well, that works. - But I had to hurry.
Whoever was behind this could be torturing Sal right now.
Brutalizing him. Maiming him. Tearing him a...
Whoa, whoa. Too graphic.
Sorry, sorry.
Finally!
Hey, guys, over here.
-(groans) -Just let it go.
Are you kidding me with this?
You got a problem?
Oh, you think? You know what you did, cutter.
Pfft. Who's cutting, weirdo?
Yeah, he was just savin' our spots.
Uh-uh. Nope. That is not how this works.
That is not how any of this works.
Doesn't anyone else see this injustice?
-(woman) Calm down, lady.
-You calm down!
Now, listen up. I'm giving you little twerps till the count of three to get to the back of the line, or I'll...
-Or you'll what? -Yeah, what?
Oh, ho-ho. News flash, kid.
I'm a monster from another world.
-I might eat newts for breakfast. -(all gasp)
(in deep voice) You wanna find out?
(whimpers, crying)
Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, don't cry.
-Did she threaten to eat those kids? -Someone call security.
I think I just made a mistake.
(siren wailing)
(gasps)
This was bigger than I could've imagined.
Whoever was behind this turned an old frog's family legacy into a soulless profit machine.
Uh, can I help you?
Shhhh.
Eh.
I had finally found the sauce, but where was Sal?
Oi! Who the heck are you?
Uh, who are you?
I'm the blooming floor manager. And you're trespassing, mate.
(grunts)
He was huge, ugly, and probably hit like a truck.
Luckily, I knew a thing or two about fisticuffs myself.
Hold on. Do I?
Huh. Lucky shot. Wouldn't be so lucky next time.
(both grunting)
(panting, groans)
(screaming)
(sizzling)
One thing was for sure, the health inspector wasn't gonna like this.
But the health inspector was the least of my concerns.
I wanted answers.
And right before me was the big cheese who had 'em all.
The jig is up, villain.
Now tell me what you've done with...
(gasps) Sal?
Hopediah. It's been a long time, old friend.
So you're behind all this! Of course.
You kidnapped yourself to steal your own, uh...
Uh, hang on a sec.
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. What are you talking about?
I went by the deli. It was ransacked.
Someone stole your recipe and sold it off to the highest bidder!
They were spreading your sauce on fancy food at a swanky gala.
Hopediah, this is my factory.
I sauce all the major events in Newtopia.
I don't believe it. The Sal I knew was a sandwich man, through and through.
(chuckles) You know, it was a tough call. The sandwich biz was dying. I knew my sauce was a hit, but nobody wanted it between slices of bread. I was nervous at first, but the change ended up being great for me. Heck, I even retired that silly fedora.
Now instead of making traditional sandwiches for no one,
I make just the sauce for everyone.
Turns out if you embrace change instead of clinging to the past,
you get a say in what the future looks like.
Heck, you can even bring some of the past along with you.
Thanks, Sal. You're a good frog.
Sorry for getting so carried away.
I almost took it too far.
What? What are you talking about?
Boss, we just found a body in vat number three.
-What? -Oh, will you look at the time?
Gotta go. Bye.
Hey, kids. Play any newfangled games?
-Actually, they banned us for life.
-It was Anne's fault.
Because I was willing to stand up for what was right.
Hey! This whole thing is their fault.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to take a step back.
Oh, yeah, like you're really gonna tase a kid...
(screaming)
Anyway, I was right, and that's that.
How 'bout you, Hop Pop? You enjoy those sandwiches?
(chuckles) Not exactly.
Looks like I had quite a tale to tell.
Quite a tale, indeed.
-Hop Pop? -Anyone home?
Oh, crud. Did I not say that out loud?
I guess that's the funny thing about narrating.
You're talking, but you're not talking, you know?
I think Hop Pop's broken.
Kids can you hear me? Is my mouth moving?
Am I gonna be stuck like this forever?
Help me, oh, frog!
(chattering)
(squawks)
Anne: Whoa. Look at this place. It's just like the outdoor mega mall from back home.
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm. Sure. Anyway, since we only have a couple of days left in the city, I figured we could spend the afternoon shopping for souvenirs. Now get out there and buy anything you'd like!
-(excited chatter)
Hop Pop: For two coppers or less.
-(grunts)
Polly: What? This ain't even enough for a candy bar.
Anne: Yeah, what gives? Let's just use that sweet bling-bling from the king-king.
Sprig: Oh, yeah. The royal credit card.
Hop Pop: Nuh-uh. Kids, souvenirs are only meaningful if you pay for them yourself.
-(all groan)
Hop Pop: You could always try haggling.
Polly: Hag what?
Hop Pop: You know, bargain with shopkeepers till they lower their prices.
Polly: You can do that? Oh, these newts aren't gonna know what hit 'em. (hops away laughing)
Hop Pop: Wait, Polly! Don't actually hit anyone!
Sprig: Ooh, exciting. I guess I'd better get an item for Ivy, since we are an item. (laughs, snorts) Who are you gonna shop for?
Anne: My mom.
Sprig: Your... mom?
Anne: I figure if I'm gonna go missing in a different dimension, the least I could do is bring back a gift.
Sprig: Seems reasonable to me.
Anne: Wha... When did you? How did you?
Sprig: Don't know. But isn't it perfect for Ivy? It even whistles when you swing it.
Anne: (grunts)
Sprig: Watch this...
(grunts)
Sprig: Wa-ta!
Vendor: -My pots!
Anne: (grabbing Sprig) Sorry, sorry! Bill the king! Bill the king.
(Anne running past Easy Street Chairs with Sprig in her arms. Inside the store is Hop Pop looking at a massage chair.)
Hop Pop: (reading the chair's label) "Massage your tucus the right way with this chair full of rumble bugs. Your life will never be the ding-dang same." (finishes reading the label) Pfft. How good could it be?
(Hop Pop sits on the chair as it vibrates)
Hop Pop: Oh, my frog!
(bird squawks)
Now, this is for my mom, okay? The lady who gave me life.
So we gotta find something that's one-of-a-kind.
-(sniffs, coughs) -What does she like?
Antiques, butterflies, drinking tea...
Okay, well, how about this box of herbal tea?
-Too ordinary. -(grunts)
-Giant butterfly taxidermy? -Too creepy.
This antique vase?
This broken antique vase?
Wait. Look over there.
Whoa. A butterfly teapot?
(Anne) And it was made by a revered Newtopian artist?
Sprig, it's perfect!
Excuse me, how much for the teapot?
Sorry, it's not for sale.
What? No, 200 coppers. No, 600 coppers.
I will pay 90,000 coppers.
Anne, you have two coppers.
It's not for sale, because it's the grand prize
in the market's annual Shopping Cart Smash and Mash Derby.
If you want the teapot, you should sign up.
You sure about this? We don't even know what this competition is.
Sprig, it's the perfect gift, and this is the only way to get it.
Nothing is gonna stand in my way.
Priscilla: (scoffs) That's what you think.
Anne: (gasps)
Priscilla: Name's Priscilla the Killa. Champion of the Smash and Mash Derby, 20 years running. This is my daughter Pearl.
Pearl: Hello.
Priscilla: And that teapot is mine.
(both laugh)
Pearl: Hey, Mom, how do you spell "winner"?
Priscilla: Just put your name, sweetie.
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm Anne, and I'm gonna destroy you in this derby thing, as soon as I figure out how to play.
-(both laugh) -This is gonna be easier than I thought.
-See you in the ring, Mop Top. -(both laugh)
-They seem confident. -Come on, dude.
We gotta study up on this game.
So, teams of two push carts around and ram into each other.
If your cart tips over, you're out.
Other than that, anything goes. Sounds like my kinda game.
(thud)
-Is it bad? -(metal clanging)
What's that noise?
Whoa. Polly?
Oh, hey. Like my new bucket?
(grunts) That's gotta be worth, like, 50 coppers.
-How'd you... -Haggling, baby.
(grunts) Turns out I'm a natural.
All you gotta do is expose a shopkeeper's weakness,
and then exploit it until they're on their knees begging for mercy.
(laughs) Oh, look, bows.
Okay, focus. Let's go win that teapot.
First, we pick our cart, which should be pretty easy.
-Give me that! -Get your own cart!
-(screams) -(Anne) Hmm.
(rattling)
(squeaking)
(sniffs, licks)
(smacks lips) Pass. This one's a C-plus at best.
-(clapping) -Wow. You're really good at this.
Me, Sasha and Marcy practically lived at the mall.
So I'm pretty much a cart whisperer.
Attention all smashers.
The Smash and Mash Derby is about to begin.
Oh, shoot. We gotta hurry.
Let's split up and find a cart already.
-But, Mom... -Ah, stop worrying, Pearl.
I've been the Derby champ 20 years running.
There's no way anyone else is winning that teapot.
That's not what I'm worried about.
It's your tail. It hasn't healed from your last derby.
Relax. I can beat these chumps without it.
-(groans) -Now, come on. Let's get outta here.
(chuckles) Very interesting.
(cheering, chattering)
-A tail injury? -Yep.
Don't know how that's gonna help us yet, but... Whoa! Polly.
Guys, meet Micro-Angelo, my private chauffeur.
(chirps)
(both) Whoa.
Well, nice chatting with ya,
but I've got more haggling to do.
Okay, focus. Let's scope out the competish.
-(growls) -(both scream)
(both) Tea pot! Tea pot! Tea pot!
It's okay, dude. We've got this.
Look, even Hop Pop believes in us.
(moaning)
Actually, I don't know what's going on there.
Yoo-hoo. Ready to lose?
-(laughs) -(grunts)
(announcer) Players, on your marks...
-(engine revving sounds) - Get ready...
All right, you crazy animals, smash and mash!
(crowd cheering)
(clamoring)
(grunts)
(grunts, screams)
(grunts)
(grunts)
(grunts)
(growls)
(snarls, groans)
-(crowd cheers) -He's fine.
(announcer) This is it, ladies and gentle-newts. Only two carts left.
Come on, Sprig. We can do this...
(both grunt, scream)
(both groan)
(crowd screams)
Looks like this battle is too big for the ring.
(Priscilla grunting)
"Page two, using the brakes."
-(both scream) -(all) Not the baby!
Initiating secret special cart maneuver, ollie pop.
Ollie what?
-(brakes squealing) -(both groan)
-(both scream) -Ah! I gotta use my tail.
It's the only way to not murder that pollywog!
But, Mom, your injury!
Hush. I have no choice.
-(groans) -Mom!
-(brakes squeals) -(Polly groans)
I wasn't worried.
-(panting) -(Anne) Hey, you guys okay?
-Yeah, we're fine. -(Anne) Okay, good.
Now, Sprig!
(all gasp)
Aw.
(groans)
(announcer) Mop Top wins. Mop Top wins!
-(crowd cheers) Mop Top! -Uh, can we not make that a thing?
Here you are, ma'am, just as promised.
(squeals) My mom is gonna love this.
-Sorry about your staff, dude. -It's okay.
If it broke this easy, it wasn't good enough for Ivy.
At least, that's what I'm telling myself.
Priscilla: Hey, Mop Top. Congratulations. You won fair and square.
Anne: Oh, uh, thanks.
Priscilla: Just make sure you take care of that thing, okay? The newt who made it was special. One-of-a-kind.
Anne: One-of-a-kind?
Priscilla: Yeah, the kind who encouraged you to follow your dreams, even if they were wacky and dangerous. (chuckles) The kind who cut the crust off your sandwiches 'cause she knew you didn't like 'em. That teapot was the last piece of art she ever made. So like I said, take care of it.
Anne: Was the artist your mom by any chance?
Priscilla: Yeah.
Anne: I was gonna give this to my mom when I got home, but I think she'd want you to have it.
Priscilla: No, I couldn't.
Anne: Please, I insist.
Priscilla: N... (sighs) Thank you. This means so much to us. You're not half bad, Mop Top.
Anne: Anne. My name's Anne.
Pearl: Hey! (Anne gasps in surprise) Thank you for being so generous. Here. (hands Anne her butterfly broach) I'd be honored if you gave it to your mom. I'm no famous artist, but I made it myself and it's one-of-a-kind.
Anne: Thank you. It's perfect.
Priscilla: Don't be a stranger, Anne.
Pearl: Bye.
Anne: Well, now that that's over, you guys seen Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Oh, heya, kids. Yoo-hoo! Eh, just packing a small souvenir, uh, then we can head out.
Anne: Whoa. You got that for two coppers?
Hop Pop: I sure did. (chuckles) Amazing what you can get for two coppers these days.
Anne: Hmm.
Hop Pop: Okay, fine. I used the credit card! I'm so ashamed. But if you could just feel this thing, kids. It's heaven on your rump. Nirvana on your tush. Bliss on your buttocks.
Anne, Sprig & Polly: We got it.
Sprig: (gasps) I just had the worst dream. You up, Anne? Anne?
(He sees Anne outside on the balcony. He walks over to her.)
Sprig: It's so pretty. I'm sure your mom's gonna love it.
Anne: Hmm. Yeah.
Sprig: What's she like?
Anne: My mom? Um, kind... in her own way. But strict too. She wanted me to study more. Thought I goofed off too much. We didn't always see eye to eye. She annoyed me sometimes too. Like, in the kitchen, she'd always sing these goofy Thai love songs, and, man, was her singing bad. Woof! That woman was beyond tone-deaf. You know, the funny thing is, right now I would give anything just to hear her singing. Whoa! Sorry, sorry. I just, uh, need a moment. (sighs)
Sprig: It's cool you know your mom, though. Mine passed away when me and Polly were really young.
(Anne looks shocked.)
Sprig: I don't even remember what she looked like really. Much less the sound of her voice. You know, I've always wondered... can you miss someone you never actually knew? (chuckles) That's silly. I mean, of course you can't.
(Anne suddenly rushes over and embraces Sprig. Feeling her arms around him makes Sprig smile and tear up.)
(Open on a tower of Newtopia Castle at night. Inside Marcy, in her pajamas is watering a potted flytrap.)
Marcy: Watering the plants, watering the plants.
(snarls)
Marcy: (screams) Branson! No, bad boy.
(knocking)
Marcy: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. They're here!
Lady Olivia: Good evening, Master Marcy. Anne Boonchuy and the Plantars have arrived for your...
(all) Sleepover!
(both) Sleepover, sleepover!
Polly: (in slow motion) Sleepover.
Olivia: (sighs) Sleepover. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the kitchen drinking... juice.
(Anne squeals and hugs Marcy, causing her to grunt from the impact.)
Anne: This is gonna be...
Marcy: Awesome!
Sprig: It's the perfect way to spend the night before we hear from the king.
Anne: I wonder what he learned about the music box.
Marcy: I don't wanna give anything away, but it's gonna be pretty cool.
Hop Pop: Okay, kids, I'll be back in the morning for our meeting with the king. You enjoy yourselves. I'm off to spend a little much needed me time. And by me time, I mean a full body...
Okay, bye, H.P.
Later, Hop Pop.
Polly: Whoo-hoo! Me and Sprig's first sleepover.
Sprig: Better make it a good one. (whispering) These will be formative memories.
Anne: Whoa, I just realized, we've never done a sleepover without Sasha.
Marcy: Oh, you're right. You think we can pull it off? Sasha's the sleepover queen, not us.
Pfft. Who says there has to be just one queen?
Everyone. That's sort of how the whole system works, Anne.
Marcy, you and I have done tons of sleepovers. We know everything about them.
(both) Pajamas, junk food and gossip galore. Pillow fights, movies and tearing up the dance floor. And listen up 'cause this I won't repeat, never ever go to sleep.
(laughs)
Sensing some missing context here.
Oh, sorry. Sasha always said falling asleep early means total failure.
A true sleepover goes till sunrise.
Enough setup. Let's get our sleepover on, baby.
Whoo-hoo! Let's do it!
(all) Whoo-hoo!
(clattering) Cowabunga!
Yeah! (chuckles)
(laughs)
Excuse me, sire.
Yes, peon?
(grunts)
(screams) Oh, for frog's sake.
(all grunting, screaming)
While I'm glad you kids are having fun...
(all groaning) ...let me remind you
that some castle rooms are off-limits,
namely the basement, which is...
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha! (screams)
Montage is back on, baby.
(all laughing) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
(Anne laughs)
(burps)
(yawns) That was awesome.
Best sleepover ever.
See, told ya we could pull off
an awesome sleepover without Sasha.
What time is it anyway? 5:00 a.m.? 6:00 a.m.?
Uh, only 9:00 p.m.?
-What? -(chuckles) That early?
But I'm so tired.
(Anne) No, stay awake! (both groaning)
Anne, I think it's time.
Really? Are you sure they're ready?
Is anyone ever really ready, Anne?
Ready? Ready for what?
(both) The Scare-Dare challenge.
Oooh.
The rules. One of us comes up with a scary dare,
and we all have to do it.
But whoever bails first gets their name added to...
-The Book of Losers. -(both gasp)
Yeah, and once your name is in the Book of Losers,
it'll be there forever.
(in deep voice) Forever.
Well, I'm sold. Let's do this.
Okay, all we need is a scary dare.
(all) Hmm, hmm, hmm.
-Yeah, I got nada. -Huh.
I don't remember it being this difficult.
That's because Sasha always came up with the best scare dares.
Oh, right. All right, what have we got to work with here?
Oh, what about the basement? Ow, paper cut.
Anne, that place is probably off-limits for a reason.
This may not be a smart idea.
Come on, Marce. It's what Sasha would do.
Well, that is true.
I hereby accept this Scare-Dare challenge.
We also accept this Scare-Dare challenge!
It is done. This Scare-Dare challenge is now...
(all in deep voices) ...official.
(snoring)
(chuckles)
(all coughing)
(all) Whoa.
So, who wants to go first?
I vote Anne. What? Why?
Well, it was your idea.
(gulps)
-(grunts) -Marcy!
(Marcy screams) Oh, no. Why am I going...
(screams)
(groans)
(gasps)
(all screaming)
Okay, that's enough.
Whoa, that's a lot of mirrors.
So, anyone wanna turn back and go into the Book of Losers?
(nervous chuckle) You kidding me?
Not me. As if.
You know, some cultures believe mirrors can ward off
malevolent spirits, or summon them.
(sinister laughing)
(both) Ooh.
Uh, Marcy, what does this say?
My command of Newtopian linguistics is limited,
but what it says should be fairly obvious.
(all) Keep out.
(door creaks) (all scream)
Okay, somebody's gotta wanna go back by now.
(shivering) I ain't going in no Book of Losers.
(shivering) Me n-neither.
Guess we'll go a bit further then.
Uh-huh. Living my best life right now.
(all straining)
What the heck?
It's some kind of creepy crypt.
Whoa-ho. You mean like with dead bodies? Cool.
Anne, we shouldn't be here.
This feels all sorts of wrong.
Guys, I, uh, think Marcy's right.
We should head back upstairs.
Oh, I see. So I guess you two are okay with going in...
(both) ...the Book of Losers.
Pfft. We don't wanna go back 'cause we're scared.
This place just isn't our style.
Okay, prove it.
Take a selfie by that coffin.
(both) Ew!
Would Sasha do this? Oh, yeah.
I have to admit... It is pretty creepy.
All right, say desecration.
(both) Desecration.
Ha! Nailed it. Oh, wait.
This photo's kinda jank.
(squeals)
(both scream)
What the heck are these things?
(both scream)
Hey, they're actually kinda cute.
-(Marcy) Sprig, don't touch it! -(Anne) Look!
(growls)
(screams) They're gonna eat our bones.
Forget this. We're losers. We lose.
(both screaming)
I don't get it. Are they aliens? Ghosts?
Does it matter? Let's get outta here, Scoob.
Roger that. Wait, what did you just call me?
(both scream) Guys, this way!
We found another exit!
(all panting) (moaning)
(Anne) Man, someone really loves mirrors.
(all scream)
(all panting)
What the... A garden?
But how are these plants growing so well without sunlight?
Mar-Mar, we don't have time for this. Come on!
(growling)
(all panting)
Whoa, someone really hated this painting.
Aaah! Hurry up!
(roaring)
(all panting)
Come on, put your backs into it.
My room? Don't question it.
Oh, thank goodness that's...
-(all screaming) -Holy toot!
Take this, you overgrown gummy worm.
(squeals)
-Quick! More books. -Way ahead of you.
-(grunts) -This isn't working.
Why are the books passing right through them?
Maybe they prefer audiobooks.
(grunts)
(moans)
(grunts)
(moaning, squeals)
What the...
(moaning)
(grunts)
It's physical? But how?
(both) The mirrors.
Both hallways to the crypt were filled with mirrors.
It looks like the refraction of their own light turns these creatures physical,
which means...
Quick, everyone, grab a mirror.
Yah!
(strains)
Hey, was anyone gonna tell me I have leaves in my hair?
(Marcy, Polly, Sprig) Not now, Anne. Oh, right, sorry. Yah!
(grunting) (whimpers)
(all panting)
So, anyone think they're going to be able
to sleep after that terrifying experience?
Nope. Nuh-uh.
Oh, heck, nah.
(alarm buzzes)
Welp, we did it.
We stayed awake all night.
Oh, I still have so many questions.
What were those things? What's the deal with the basement?
And if those were really ghosts, is there actually an afterlife?
I didn't even think about that.
Well, one thing's for sure.
That sleepover was amazing.
It was the best.
(sighs) I just wish I didn't have to add my name to the Book of Losers.
(blows raspberry) Me either.
Hand me that pen. You're not the only losers.
I was scared outta my mind.
Me too. (chuckles)
It's not the first time either.
(Polly) For real? (Marcy) Have a look.
(Sprig) Whoa. Your names are in here a bunch of times.
Yep, the only one brave enough to never get in the book was Sasha.
(sighs) We have to find her, Marcy.
I need to make things right.
We will, Anne. I just know it.
-(knocking) -(all scream)
Rise and shine, kids.
Because of you, I barely slept a wink last night.
Ugh, well, whatever. It's go time.
Your audience with King Andrias is about to begin.
Get ready!
(all laughing)
(giggles)
(all screaming)
(all yawn)
Oh, boy.
King Andrias: Wonderful to see you all again.
Your Majesty.
'Sup, King?
King Andrias: So ask me if I found out anything about the box.
Anne: Did you...
King Andrias: Bingo! (laughs) Ta-da! Take a gander.
(Everyone gasps as they look at the gigantic book and the content within it.)
Sprig: It's the music box!
King Andrias: According to this book, it's a magical artifact that is thousands of years old. Apparently, my ancestors used it to visit entirely different worlds. They were peaceful explorers, scientists, if you will. These three stones are the key to getting it working again. They need to be recharged.
Anne: Recharged? How?
King Andrias: The book mentions three different temples, each channeling a different kind of energy. And once the stones are recharged...
Anne: We'll have a way home?
King Andrias: Steal my thunder, why don't you? But yes! Boom! Eh, eh?
Anne: I don't believe it. A real chance to get home.
Marcy: Right? Now let's get out there and conquer these bad boys.
Whoo-hoo!
King Andrias: Whoa-ho. Let's rein those snails in for a sec. The book only gives the location of one temple. Besides, you still have a lot of preparing to do before you set off.
Marcy: Good point. Gotta get equipped for a mega-quest like this. Armor to buy, maps to study, weapons to forge. This is gonna take a few days.
Hop Pop: Few days, huh? Well, I hate to say it, but we really need to get back to Wartwood. The harvest is coming up and we can't miss it.
Anne: Okay, Marce, me and the Plantars will head back to Wartwood, and when you're ready we can just meet up.
Marcy: Whoa, whoa, whoa. It doesn't really make sense for you to go back to Wartwood.
Anne: Say what now?
(all) What?
Marcy: The last thing we should do is separate again, now that we're so close to finding our way home.
Anne: I guess that's true, but, uh, I, uh, need to go to Wartwood to get the music box. Right, H.P.?
Hop Pop: Technically, yes.
Marcy: Nonsense. Once Hop Pop gets the box back, we'll just send a servant to pick it up. More efficient that way.
Anne: Yeah, but...
Marcy: Anne, right now you have to follow your head, not your heart. The Plantars got you here, to me. It's time to let them get back to their lives. Why don't you guys take the day to say goodbye?
(all groan)
King Andrias: You folks want a giant tissue? Seriously, you would not believe the size of these tissues. (chuckles) I'll get you one.
(whimpers)
(Hop Pop, Polly, and Sprig sigh)
Hey, guys, come on. It's not like this is goodbye forever.
You know what, gang? Anne's right. The least we can do is have a fun last day together.
Now come on, let's pick an activity.
There's the opera house, the coliseum, the aquarium.
(Anne) There's an aquarium? That's perfect. Anytime I was feeling gloomy back home, the aquarium would always make me feel better. There's nothing more peaceful than being surrounded by water and sea creatures.
Oh, good thinking, Anne.
Works for me.
Yeah! Let's go have fun and not think about our crippling sadness.
Nice one.
(children) Ooh.
(chattering, laughing)
(chitters)
Look at the beaver bugs. They're so cute.
What'd I tell you? The perfect place to relax and take our minds off...
(all scream)
(chuckles) Oh, hey. Check it out. It's the same kinda eel that attacked you kids when the basement flooded, remember? Kids?
(sighs) Those were good times, weren't they?
Yeah, it's too bad that they're over.
(whimpers)
No! No, Sprig. Fight the sadness. Fight it. Come on, buddy. Come here. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. (both whimpering)
Okay, River Room is a bust. Let's keep moving.
Okay, if we're gonna have a sadness-free day, we need to avoid anything that might trigger our very delicate emotional states.
Actually, this is pretty peaceful.
-Yeah. -So soothing.
(all sigh)
(growling)
-Hey, look, a kraken. -It is. Ha!
Anne, it's like the one you tried to cook up at Stumpy's.
Who knew fish sauce and fear of death went so well together?
(all whimpering, crying)
Okay, that's enough. Time to change rooms, everybody.
(all panting)
Oh, cool. A marine geology exhibit.
Nothing to remind us of our adventures in here.
Wow, this coral is so neat.
Oh, look, that stalk looks exactly like...
(all gasp) Hop Pop's cane!
-(Hop Pop) My cane. -Oh, no. That one looks like...
-(all) Domino 2. -(gasps)
Sprig: The cannibal couple from the inn!
Polly: (gasps) Mud Men!
Anne: Grubhog!
Hop Pop: Zapapedes!
Sprig: Veggie-robo!
Anne: (sobbing) Who knew coral came in such variety?
(all crying)
Excuse me, folks, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Your misery is scaring the efts.
(cries)
Hoop. No emotion.
(sighs) Sorry, guys. Looks like my grand plan for a sadness-free day at the aquarium is a total bust.
Well, If you folks are feeling blue, you could try the Stingray Stage Show. Always cheers me up.
Ooh, a stage show? Those are the best. Wait. Did we have any run-ins with stingrays? Anything even slightly resembling a stingray?
Nope.
Don't think so.
Then let's go.
(all) Whoo!
Show's that way, folks.
(crowd cheering)
All right, give it up for our stingrays, Sugar Ray and Billy Ray. And now for the main event, II'll need a volunteer.
-Oh, oh, me, me.
-You, the pink frog over there!
Come on down.
(crowd cheering, whistling)
What's your name, and where are you from?
-Sprig Plantar from Wartwood.
-Wartwood represent!
Well, Sprig Plantar, all you gotta do is put this fish in your hands and hold it out over the tank.
Sprig: And the stingray will jump out and eat it?
Usually, but we have a very special guest today. Everyone put your hands together for Wanda the Water Snake.
(hisses)
(both gasp)
Hop Pop: Well, that's pretty cool... Wait, what's wrong?
Anne: It looks exactly like the water snake that almost ate me and Sprig.
Hop Pop: What? When?
Anne: That was the day you tried to lock us in the house!
Hop Pop: I knew it! You two always... (starts crying) ...disobeying and causing trouble!
Polly: That was the day I realized you weren't going to eat us!
(all crying)
Now, Wanda will leap up and eat the fish right out of this lucky kiddo's hand. And so long as he doesn't do anything to surprise her, this should be perfectly safe.
Oh, no! Sprig's about to...
-(growls) -(whimpering)
(crying)
(screams)
(sobs)
We've gotta get Sprig away from that snake.
Oh, you've got nothing to fear from ol' Wanda. The gal's afraid of her own shadow.
That's a relief. Close call.
Oh, no, no, no. It's the rays you should be worried about. Yeah, they love the taste of frog flesh.
(sobbing)
Sprig!
Hey, buddy, you set 'em up...
(gasps) I'll knock 'em down.
(grunts) (growls)
(growls) (grunts)
(whimpers)
(growls)
(grunting)
Over here, Hop Pop!
Bleh!
Bleh! (grunts)
Mmm. (growls)
(whimpers)
Whoa!
(snarls)
You're up, Polly.
(grunts) (gargles, spits)
Yes, be free.
(all) Yeah!
And stay out!
Oh, man. That was classic.
We stung those stingrays.
Well, we didn't have a relaxing day at the aquarium.
But now we've got another perfectly us-memory to cherish.
(all laughing)
(birds squawking)
Have a safe trip back, Plantars.
Let us know when you get the music box, and we'll send someone to come get it.
Thank you kindly, Marcy.
No more tears, y'all. We'll see each other again.
Will we, though? When?
I don't know, but we're family, and family always finds each other.
(both) Spranne against the world!
(both laugh)
(sighs) I'm sorry, Anne. This just made the most sense.
I know. I know. (sniffles) Logical thing to do.
Marcy: (sighs) You know, the more I think about it, maybe sending a servant to get the music box isn't such a good idea. We need someone looking after that thing the second Hop Pop gets it back. Someone we trust.
(Anne turns to Marcy.)
Marcy: I'm sure I can handle the preparations here by myself. I'll just come pick you up on the way to the first... (grunts when Anne hugs her) ...temple.
Anne: Thanks, Marcy.
Marcy: (chuckles) Now go. Follow your heart.
Anne: Okay, later! Bye!
(squawks)
Doris: You go get 'em, girl!
Anne: See you, Doris!
Sewer Gator: Whoo-hoo-hoo.
(horn honks)
Oh, so safety doesn't matter now?
Gertie: Wanna try my new gnatchos, Anne?
Anne: Some other time, Gertie!
(all sigh)
-(chirps) -(all scream)
What in the... Anne?
Anne: I'm coming with you to Wartwood!
Yeah!
Glad to have you back, Anne.
Hop on up here, sister.
Thank frog! I really didn't know how I was gonna make it without you.
Now let's go home.
King Andrias: Always sad to see someone go, isn't it? I have a proposition for you, Marcy, and I think you'll find it very interesting.
(Late at night, Anne drives the fwagon while Hop Pop sits beside her, making sure she doesn't fall off.)
Sprig: All right, Polly, check this out! According to this map, if we drive straight through the night, we'll be home by morning!
Polly: (sighs) Say "home" again.
Sprig: Just think. Home for breakfast.
Polly: Mmm! Pillbug pancakes.
Sprig: Hanging out with Ivy.
Ivy (fantasy): 'Sup.
Sprig: Not that it's a big deal. (chuckles)
(loud crash) Huh?
(grunts)
Whoa! Where do you guys think you're going?
We've got a schedule to keep.
Guys, we've been driving nonstop for like 20 hours.
Just a little shut-eye and we'll be back on the road by morning.
But we're so close!
Yeah! Can't you just power through one more night? Please, please, please? I wanna sleep in a real bed.
I know how you guys feel, but you're not the ones who have to drive.
Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you two sleep, and we can get us home!
Yeah! Remember how we owned Quarreler's Pass?
(chuckles) Oh, you sweet, sweet, ignorant kids. Amphibia changes at night. And not for the better, let me tell you. The nocturnal leech flies are bad enough, but I've even heard folks tell of evil spirits wandering these parts. Real spookums and such! Haven't seen any myself, of course, but you know, could happen.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Plus, neither of you read Bessie's driving manual!
But...
Forget it. You're not driving, and that's final.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
(groans, snoring)
(Polly) This is messed up!
Sure, we're young and made mistakes.
But we've proven we can handle ourselves!
I know, right?
What in the world could be so dangerous out there that we haven't lived through already?
I've been eaten eight times, Sprig. Eight times. (whispers) I sort of look forward to it now.
Hey, wait a sec. Hop Pop and Anne are asleep, right? So asleep they won't even know if we take the reins and drive us home right now! And when they wake up, they'll be so grateful to be home, they'll completely forget to be mad at us!
Sprig, you creepy little genius!
You sure they're not gonna wake up though, right?
Absolutely! Those two are out cold.
Huh. Wonder if they'll have any dreams.
(snoring)
(gasps)
Oh, no. It's like all my stresses have physically manifested as hideous monsters!
Or something.
(roaring)
(screams) Looks like that's it for me! (grunts)
Huh?
I'm floatin'. Wait a second. This must be a dream.
And if it's a dream, I can control it!
(laughs) For the first time in my life, I feel free!
Come on, you freaks! Follow me!
- (chittering) - (laughing)
(chuckling)
(snoring)
No stinking way!
(chattering, singing)
Welcome to Yogurtropolis, ma'am. Would you like a free sample from my body?
Uh, sure! You guys got anything without bugs in it?
Bugs? Our yogurt doesn't have any bugs!
Did you say "no bugs"?
That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. (sniffs)
All right, little yogurt man, what flavors you got? Green tea? Caramel? Hazelnut?
(cackles)
Oh, I'm afraid we only have one flavor here, ma'am.
What? No! No!
Licorice! (evil laugh)
No!
No, no. (laughing)
All right. Let's do this!
Whoo-hoo! (both laughing)
(both screaming, laughing)
Sprig, have I ever told you you're such a great night driver?
Why, thank you, Polly,
but it is you who is the excellent night driver.
(both laughing)
Well, end of the line, Polly.
There's no way we can dodge a couple of li'l pebbles.
(both laughing)
Well, that's a big rock.
(all screaming)
Well, we obviously nailed that. But, uh, should we stop?
Pshaw! No way! That all you got, night driving?
Then, away we go.
Murder! Murder!
(screeches)
(chuckles) Could this place get any creepier? Wait, who's that?
Huh. Hitchhiker. What's, uh, our policy on those?
Just play it cool. Maybe he's friendly.
(clears throat)
Hey there, mister. Like that hat.
Anything we can help you with today?
(screaming) Punch it, Sprig!
Whew! (chuckles) Well, that was close.
Good thing we're way too good at night driving. Preach!
The Foggy Fjords? How foggy could it be?
Oh.
(creature screeches)
What do you think those things even are?
I don't have the foggiest idea.
Sorry, sorry.
Crazy stuff.
Oh, hey, wait a second. I don't see the road anymore.
Polly, are we even going the right way?
Hey, look! There's someone! Maybe we can ask... them.
Oh, my Frog, it's the hitchhiker!
It can't be! Don't make eye contact.
Too late.
A fork in the road!
And he's pointing left!
Ahh! Then go right! Right!
(screaming)
(screaming) (creature roars)
(wind) Sprig. Polly.
(Polly) What the heck is that?
(panting)
Where is the hitchhiker? Did we lose em'?
Definitely. There's no way he could follow us.
(both) Whew!
Hey, did you just get a chill? What?
(screaming)
He's tryin' to steal our wagon! Oh, no, you don't!
That's it! (grunts) Take that, you prevert!
Uh-oh. (screams)
Aagh! I've been hooked!
Polly! Hang on!
Oh, no, the seat. Hop Pop's gonna kill us!
Focus, Sprig!
(screaming)
(warbles)
Polly, you impaled?
Um, no, not yet.
Huh. Me neither.
(gasps) The hitchhiker. He's gone.
Whoa! And not only that, Sprig.
But look where we are... the valley!
We did it! (echoing)
(Sprig) Good thing we stopped when we did. We woulda been goners! (laughs)
Yeah! And it's all 'cause we're the greatest night drivers ever...
- (screams) - What? What is it?
It's the hitchhiker! He's back!
Wait a minute. It's... a statue.
Huh. It says here,
"This monument is dedicated to Zechariah Nettles,
who spent his days guiding travelers away from danger
on their way back home."
Oh, man! Polly, what if that hitchhiker
wasn't trying to hurt us,
he was trying to help us?
He did try to make us take that other path.
And look. There's the path we were on.
And there's the path he wanted us to use. Aww, it looks nice.
Between that, stopping us from driving off this cliff and how he just disappeared,
I don't think there's any way around it.
You tellin' me that hitchhiker was the ghost of ol' Zechariah,
returning from the grave to do us a solid?
Sure seems like it.
(both) Whoa.
What the heck in a handbasket is goin' on out here?
You better not have disobeyed me!
Dang it! Of all the irresponsible, inconsiderate, juvenile...
Wait, HP. Look at them.
(together) A ghost, a ghost, a ghost with the most!
Without Mr. Nettles, we'd surely be deadles!
Pfft! (laughs)
(snoring)
I don't know what happened last night,
but it looks like they've already learned their lesson.
(sighs) All right, all right. I'll let this one slide.
(both snoring) (squeaks)
Say, Anne, did you have any weird dreams last night?
I thought you'd never ask! It was horrible, Hop Pop. Horrible!
Okay, so I was in this town full of yogurt, right...
I was a god in my dream!
Hop Pop: (inhales) Ah, how I miss the swamp air. The aroma of grass, a whisper of manure, and just a pinch of humidity. Do you feel that humidity, Anne?
(Anne's hair is shown to be very frazzled from the humidity.)
Anne: A pinch.
Polly: (gasps, pops out of Anne's hair) I see it! I see it! I can see Wartwood!
(gasps) Whoa.
Sprig:  Wartwood, O mighty Wartwood 
 I sing to thee Our noble history 
-  A newt told a toad... 
Mrs. Croaker: Hey, I know that irritating voice.
 But don't let them escape poverty 
Mrs. Croaker: The Plantars are back! Get out here, everyone! It's the Plantars!
- Ooh! - Oh, hi!
Hiya, folks!
- Hoppy! - Sylvia!
Come here, city boy!
Any luck finding a way back to your world, Anne?
Not yet. But we're whittling away at it.
(chuckles) That wood reference was for me.
Well, if it isn't the Plantars! Buba-dee buba-dee bup. Haven't seen you lot for a long time.
Uh, definitely didn't see you on your trip.
Whatever you say, "Walliam."
(clears throat)
Sprig: Uh, hey, Felicia. Where's Ivy?
Felicia: Oh, she said she had something more important to do.
Sprig: More important?
Felicia: Something about an...
Ivy: Ambush!
(Ivy tackles Sprig)
Sprig: Uh... hi.
Ivy: Hey, you.
(all) Aww! Isn't it cute?
Toadie: Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Mayor Toadstool: Just simmer down now! Come on, simmer down. Market stops for no one. Y'all can welcome back the Plantars after business hours.
Stumpy: Oh! How about we all meet at my restaurant tonight? Have a town dinner for the Plantars.
Hop Pop: We're in. I can't wait for some authentic swamp cooking!
Stumpy: And I can't wait for that Newtopian coral hand fitment. Thanks for pickin' it up for me.
Mrs. Croaker: Say, if we're all gonna be together anyway, why not bring all the gifts from our wish list?
(excited chattering)
Sprig: Gifts?
Anne: Wish list?
Hop Pop: Great idea, Mrs. Croaker.
(loud yawn)
Polly: Can we go home, Hop Papa? I'm so "sweeeepy."
Hop Pop: Of course, my sweet baby child. Okay, here we go! Come on, kids!
Okay, bye.
(grunting)
Anne: Do you want this one?
Sprig: No, no, all yours.
(tapping)
Anne: What the heck is going on?
Hop Pop: Aha! Found it.
Polly: So, uh, remember when Hop Pop and I went to pick up the Fwagon?
Polly (narrating): Well, on our way back, Mrs. Croaker asked if we could pick her up a new romance novel while we were in the city.
Hop Pop (narrating): Before we knew it, everybody was asking for stuff. So we made a wish list. We hid the list in a special place so we wouldn't forget. And then we forgot it.
Anne: What?
Polly: I'm so sorry, you guys. Please don't get mad.
Anne: (to Polly) Oh, no, no, no. It's okay, Polly. You're just a baby. (to Hop Pop) But you! I cannot believe you forgot about something so important, Hop Pop!
Hop Pop: Look, I'm sure we can find a way to bury this so no one finds out.
Anne: Nope. Lying will only make it worse. I feel like we've learned that lesson by now.
Sprig: Well, one thing's for sure. We have to lie.
Anne: Preach! Wait, what?
Sprig: Ivy asked for a red sunshell from the Newtopian coast. To match my blue moonshell.
Anne: Oh!
Sprig: She can't find out, Anne. What if she gets mad? What if she thinks I don't like her? The relationship will be over before it starts!
Anne: (grunts) Fine! I'll do it for Sprivy. No way I'm letting that ship sink.
Great. Now, let's put our heads together and come up with a plan.
Anne: Oh, yeah, and we'd better hurry, or you might forget.
It was one time, Anne!
Hop Pop: Bye, Chuck. Thanks for watching the house, Chuck.
Chuck: I grew tulips.
Okay, so we agree on the concept.
Fake empty gift boxes that get tragically destroyed by some kind of monster.
But what monster? Nothing too dangerous.
We don't want anyone to actually get hurt.
Sprig: How about this? The Chicka-lisk. A beast that eats gold and treasure, doesn't eat Amphibians, won't attack unless threatened, and can be called to any area with a ritual.
Where'd you get that book? This cover made out of skin?
Sprig: Maddie gave it to me.
Aw, that's nice.
I gotta say, this Chicka-lisk is pretty perfect.
Gifts get eaten, no one gets hurt, and we don't get blamed.
We all okay with using ancient Eldritch magics? Sure. Why not?
Gotta do what we gotta do. I'd be mad if we didn't!
Great! Now to collect all the materials we need for the ritual.
First, we need the horn of a sky goat,
whose arcane note pierces the air.
(goat bleats)
Sprig: Then we need cursed obsidian to amplify the dark energy.
Anne: Finally, we need candles for that evil ritual vibe.
Polly: Wait, that's not in the book.
Anne: Trust me, it's a thing. Oooh! They have "campfire!"
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Play the forbidden note.
(inhales deeply)
(horn blares)
Hop Pop: Corrupt its sacred message.
Hop Pop: All righty then! Now, who wants Stumpy's?
All (except Hop Pop): Whoo!
(upbeat music playing) Wow.
Chuck: I like tulips.
Mrs. Croaker: You don't say?
Can we open the gifts soon? I'm itching for that hand.
Not literally. No feelin' in it.
(chuckles) Presents seem like an "end of the night" thing.
Why rush it?
Sprig: And I barely got out of the ant queen's stomach alive! I'm still coughing up acid. (laughs) Blegh!
Ivy: I'm so jealous! At least when I look at my sunshell, it'll be like a piece of me was there with you.
Sprig: But, uh, end of the day, it's just a shell, right?
Ivy: It's our shell. I'm really happy you found me one.
(clears throat)
(creature shrieking)
Sprig: Oh, thank frog. Finally.
Hmm?
(chorus)  Chicka-lisk, Chicka-lisk 
 Watch out for Chicka-lisk 
 Chicka-lisk, Chicka-lisk  (shrieking)
 Watch out for Chicka-lisk 
What is that thing?
Maddie: Chicka-lisk, the Storm Bearer. It's an honor to see him. You know, before he kills us.
Anne and the Plantars: Oh, no! Who could have predicted this?
Don't overdo it.
(squawking)
(shrieking)
What the heck is it saying? No idea.
Its language is older than written history.
Oh, no! It is eating the presents.
We should probably leave it alone till it's finished.
No way!
You guys did something nice for us.
Are we gonna let some chicken get away with this? Would the Plantars?
(all) No!
Well, then, come on! Let's save those presents!
For the Plantars!
(all) For the Plantars!
Sprig: Wait, no, Ivy!
Hop Pop: Uh-oh.
Anne: I can't believe it's finally my turn to say this, but... told you so! Boom!
Ivy: Eat this, you chump!
(shrieks)
(grunts)
Loggle: I'm Loggle.
(screams)
Sprig! Let's spatchcock this chicken!
Aye, aye!
Wait, guys, we gotta work together!
Who knows what this thing can do!
(screaming)
Holy moly! Cool!
Maddie! Can you cure them?
Uh, yeah, sure. I should have enough antidote for everyone... probably.
Good enough.
For Wartwood!
(all) For Wartwood!
You have beautiful eyes.
Split up! We gotta surround it! Okay!
Oh, my go... Oh, wait.
Aim for the eyes, children!
(screaming)
Yee-hah!
Anne: Nice! Using Toadie's stone body as a shield.
Mayor Toadstool: Wait, he's stone?
Mrs. Croaker: Upsy-daisy, Archie.
(grunting)
(shrieking)
This thing's unbeatable!
Mayor Toadstool: Nothing's unbeatable! Everyone, Chicka-lisk formation!
Toadie: We have a formation for this?
Mayor Toadstool: We have a formation for everything!
(all grunting and into their formation)
Mayor Toadstool: Come on, Anne!
(Anne joins with the Chicka-Lisk formation up top as the Chicka-Lisk looks at them left and right with the eyes)
Chicka-Lisk (subtitled while crowing): Okay that's just offensive, you guys. Chicka-Lisk, out!
 Chicka-lisk 
(the Chicka-Lisk then disappears)
(cheering) We did it!
Finger lickin' gone!
But it destroyed all the gifts you worked so hard to bring back for us!
If only we had fought harder. I guess we let you guys down.
(crowd murmuring) It's a shame.
Polly: Me and Hop Pop forgot the wish list and didn't get you guys anything!
All: What?
Can you believe it? The nerve of it all.
Mayor Toadstool: Why am I not surprised? Typical Plantars. Giant monsters, property damage, putting the entire town in danger.
(Anne and the Plantars look down in shame.)
Mayor Toadstool (chuckles): I gotta admit, I missed it!
Hear! Hear! Me too.
(all) Huh?
Mayor Toadstool: Things have been really boring without you four causing mayhem and learning emotional lessons.
Wait, so you don't care that we lied
and summoned an elder god to cover it up?
Stumpy: Not especially. We're just glad you're back.
Sprig: Ivy, I'm sorry I didn't get you a red sunshell. (Ivy friendly punches Sprig) Ow!
Ivy: You big dummy! It's just a shell. You can make it up to me by finally taking me on a date.
(Ivy kisses Sprig on the cheek as Sprig gets a happy reaction)
Anne: (squealing)
(Polly then grabs Anne)
Polly: Okay, we're done here.
(Sprig while being still and happy faints while Maddie throws the potion on him thinking he's a statue)
Happy Shut-In!
Thank you.
(laughing)
(knocking)
Anne/Polly/Sprig: Stay inside, hide your eyes, give us practical supplies!
Felicia: Oh, you're just in time. I've got one last box of nails. And they're rusty.
Ooh. The good stuff!
(both) Thank you.
Happy Shut-In, kids.
You too, Felicia.
Happy Shut-In!
Right back at ya!
Anne: Ooh. Man, this is a workout. Explain this holiday to me again.
Sprig: It's not a holiday, Anne. It's the annual Blue Moon Shut-In.
Polly: We need the supplies to survive through the night.
Anne: Huh. Well, you know, we have a similar thing in my world called Halloween. We say "Trick or treat," and people give you free candy.
Polly: Free candy! What's the catch?
Anne: If they don't give it to you, you get to play a trick on them.
Polly: (gasps) That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Hop Pop: Hey, kids. What'd y'all get for tonight's Shut-In? Show me the goods.
Polly: I got a hatchet.
Sprig: I got a first-aid kit.
Anne: I got a flamethrower!
(Anne uses said weapon: surprised and jealous, Polly tosses her hatchet on the ground and pouts.)
(screams)
Stumpy: Ooh. Been there.
I need a bath.
You sure this isn't a holiday? You even have jack-o'lanterns.
Those are fear gourds, Anne, and, yes, I'm sure. The Shut-In is dangerous, for tonight the moon turns blue, and anyone who gazes upon it becomes a hideous beast!
And is this true or just a legend? 'Cause sometimes it's hard to get a handle on what's real around here.
No one knows, Anne.
And no one wants to find out!
Ever.
Anne: You guys are really close to my face right now.
Whoa. So when you say "shut-in," you really mean it, huh?
It's actually kinda nice. We sit by the fire--
And tell spooky stories.
And Bessie hides in her shell till morning.
Cool! Let's get this holiday started.
(together) It's not a holiday, Anne.
Fine. Okay.
Would you grab the rest of the decorations from the cart?
It's totally a holiday.
(Hop Pop) I heard that.
(both) Stories! Stories! Stories!
Remember, the stories have to have actually happened and be scary enough to remind us (deep, scary voice) not to go outside! Okay, kids, who wants to go first?
Ooh, ooh! I do!
This is the first year I have one that's really scary. I'm telling the story of "A Night at the Inn." I was traveling with my family on a stormy night. Little did I know, I would soon come face to face with cannibals!
Uh, Polly? We were all there for that.
Oh, right. Hmm. Gimme a minute. I'll come up with another one. Someone else go!
Ooh, I got one. Now, this didn't happen to me, but it did happen to my phone. Get ready for the tale of... "Phone Mo."
Phone what?
"Phone Mo." Like FOMO--- fear of missing out, but with your phone!
(Sprig) I still don't get it.
(Polly) Me neither.
(Hop Pop) Try to make sense, Anne.
(Anne) Just let me tell my story! Anyway, it took place at a school that was like my school, but not my school! And this story wasn't about me. It was about a different girl named, uh... Anna.
(boy) Yo, Anna! What's up?
(grunts)
'Sup, Twig, and...
Molly.
Right.
Hey, check this out, guys.
(chuckles) I'm totally skateboarding-- (screams)
Aw, shucks. (screaming)
(all laughing)
Classic. Hilarious.
(chuckles) Comedy has truly peaked.
'Sup, Haddie? 'Sup, Broadie?
Hey. Have you guys seen the latest trending cute animal video?
Cute animal?
No!
I need this!
Show 'em, Broadie.
Oh, wait. I should probably tell you, people say this video is cursed and everyone who watched it has... mysteriously disappeared. So, ready to watch it?
-(all) Uh...
I don't know, guys. Is it really worth the risk?
(sighs) You may be right, Twig.
Yeah, or... you may be wrong! Show me the video!
(children laughing on video)
(Molly squeals)
Maybe we could watch just a little?
No, Anna. Be strong.
Aw, that's so cute! See?
But look how happy they are.
I said be strong.
Thanks, Twig.
I, for one, am glad we didn't watch that video.
Right? I'm so sick of doing things just because everyone else is.
Feels nice to have autonomy for a change. (bell rings)
Oop! Time for class. Gotta do what the bell says.
(sneakers squeaking)
Autonomy, shunonomy. It's video time, baby!
(tinkly music plays)
(animal squeaks)
Oh!
(children laughing) (fly buzzing)
Man, what even is this little gremlin?
Cutest... video... ever. So worth it.
Wow.
Not a single dislike or negative comment.
Looks like this is the one video on the Internet that everyone loves. Weird.
Ah! Very weird.
 Gonna eat my sandwich Into a square 
 'Cause if I spit Along the edges 
 Then I don't have to share 
And they say I'm not talented.
Haddie, is everything okay?
Broadie's gone missing.
One second he was with me, the next, only his phone was there.
You don't think the curse... Is real?
Pfft. Nah. He's probably just playing a prank on you.
Right, right. It's just a prank.
(buzzing) (both gasp)
Ah! What the...
(tinkly music plays)
(both laugh nervously)
I'm sure it's nothing.
Let me know if you find Broadie.
(phone vibrates)
(tinkly music plays) No! No! Aaah!
(laughs) (bell rings)
(as Gila monster) But, flamingo, we can't elope!
(as flamingo) Shut up and give me some sugar, you Gila monster!
(growling)
And they say I can't write dialogue.
(phone ringing)
What's the sitch, Twig?
I don't know if you've heard, but Broadie, Haddie and Molly have all gone missing!
The video. (gasps) The curse is real.
Sure looks that way. Good thing neither of us watched it, right?
(groans) No, Anna. You didn't.
I'm weak, okay?
Don't panic. Just get rid of your phone and-
(laughter) (Anna gasps)
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Wait a second.
Broadie. Molly. Haddie.
They aren't missing... (gasps)
Hey, help me! I've been trapped in here for 35 years!
(shouts)
(laughing)
I do not like where this is going.
Aaah!
Ah! Stay away from me, you adorable beast!
Take that!
And that! And that!
What the...
(roars)
(screams)
Oh, my gosh.
(as Gila monster) I'll save you, my love. (grunts)
You know, now that I've gotten a closer look at you, you are not cute at all!
(whimpers)
(roars)
Wait a second.
Did that hurt your feelings?
Can't take criticism, huh?
Well, in that case...
Bupadee-bupadee-bop.
Dis... like!
(screams)
Dislike.
And now, for the final touch,
a nasty comment.
Worst video ever.
Into the trash it goes!
(grunts)
(all groaning)
Well, consider me traumatized.
What the heck is this stuff?
Hey, it's boba.
Guys, you're okay.
That's the last time I succumb to any kind of peer pressure.
Well, I should probably go reconnect with my family.
(screams) (cat screeches)
(gasps) Twig!
What is it? What's wrong?
(pants) Guys!
This crazy new burger place just opened
on the haunted side of town.
Everyone's doing it. Come on, let's go!
Yeah! Whoo! Haunted burgers!
(all laughing)
(evil laughter)
(shrieks)
The end.
Not bad. Scary.
(phone beeps) (all gasp)
Oh!
Just a calendar alert reminding me it's Wally's birthday.
(accordion plays)
I'm sure he's fine.
All right, Polly. Back to you.
All right, all right. Here we go.
Once upon a time, an entire town got taken over by zombie mushrooms
in a story I like to call...
"Children of the Spore."
Whoa, hang on. That story's no good either.
We were there. Been there, done that.
That was actually my fault.
(sighs) All right, all right. Someone else go.
Okay, I've got one.
And it's the scariest one yet. It's called...
(in scary voice) "Dead End."
Long ago, when I was just a young frog,
I got my first job as a wagoner.
But never mind that. I had the most beautiful thicket of hair
that Wartwood had ever seen.
It had bounce. It had shine.
It was so thick, when I ran my fingers through it,
my hand would get stuck--
(Anne) Enough about the hair! All right, all right. Geez.
So, one day, I picked up a very strange customer...
Whoa there.
Let's see here. Mr. Littlepot, I presume?
You presume correctly.
Hup! Welcome aboard.
Mighty obliged.
We'll stop at each of these addresses in order, if you please.
And when I ask you to drive on, you do so. Understood?
Can do. Hyah!
Now, for the matter of payment...
Oh, nonsense.
You can pay at the end.
If you're satisfied with your service.
My, oh, my.
An honest businessman?
You are a rare sort, indeed.
So, what kinda business are you in?
Oh, let's just say I'm in the frog business.
(maniacal laugh)
The frog business? Uh, ain't we all.
Okay, stop number one.
Oh, hey. This is Old Man Hopkins' house.
Poor guy's been laid up with red leg for weeks now.
Oh, I'm sure it won't ail him for much longer.
Huh. Probably woulda knocked first, but that's just me.
(crashing)
(humming)
Well, that was fast.
Always is. Onto the next one.
Okay.
(frog woman) Mr. Hopkins! Mr. Hopkins, wake up!
Oh, uh, should we check on him?
I'm sorry, Hopediah, but it's very important we stay on schedule.
 Mama's little tadpole 
 Loves shortbread Shortbread 
(scatting)
(gasps) Is that a slaughter snake?
One bite from that thing could take out a frog in seconds.
We gotta warn that lady!
Huh?
Okay, good idea.
You warn her, and I'll watch the wagon.
(frog woman screaming) Ma'am!
(knocking) Aaah!
Time's a-wasting, Hopediah.
But you-- I heard a scream.
Next stop, if you please.
But that farmer lady.
I am asking you to drive on.
Are you trying to go against our agreement, Hopediah?
Mm.
Boy, uh, we sure are running into a lot of bad luck today, huh?
Why, it almost seems like Death is following us wherever we go.
Following?
Or riding in the back seat.
Aaah!
You! I-- But-- No!
Stay away from me, Frog Reaper!
Hopediah, please don't make a fuss.
I didn't do anything to those frogs.
I'm like you, just taking them where they need to go.
Hmm. Now...
there's only one stop left, then this money is yours.
(sighs) Okay.
Let's see here. Uh...
Next stop is...
(gasps)
No! My house?
Don't take me! Please!
I'm sorry, Hopediah.
Time's up.
(maniacal laughter)
I'm alive?
But then... Wait.
No.
No! My hair! (echoing)
(maniacal laughter)
You've still got it, Littlepot.
(clicks tongue)
You've still got it.
(sniffs, sighs)
And that, children, is how I lost my hair.
Hop Pop, that story was messed up.
Meh, I wasn't that scared.
Oh, you will be.
Okay, Polly. You got your scary story? Yes.
There was a time when frogs lived in fear of a monster
that lurked in the woods.
Scary. Now we're talking.
It had a giant head, spindly legs
and a hideous face bump!
Ooh! Ooh!
Me? Your scary story is me?
Ugh! Way to spoil the ending, Anne.
You're telling me I'm the monster in your story?
Also, your drawing is insulting.
Wah! You people are impossible to please.
Oh, oh! I've got a story.
A few days ago, Ivy and I were playing bugball on the old court in the woods--
Wait. What's your story called?
Huh? Oh, actually I don't kn--
(scary voice) "Skin Deep."
(laughing)
From downtown Bog Bottom.
Rejected! (grunts)
Argh! Don't look, don't look.
(sighs) Sorry, sorry. Just I really hate my hair.
Well, I like your hair.
Thanks, but all the same, I'd rather just cover it up.
Now come on, let's go get our bugball.
Man, that thing went far. We gotta be careful.
We're getting pretty close to the home of...
(in distorted voice) the Seamstress!
The Seamstress?
Yep! Legend says that she's a horrible creature
who sucks the life out of any frog that trespasses on her property,
then steals their skin to wear as clothes.
What? Why?
Nobody knows.
Ah, but that's just an old fly's tale.
(chuckles) Yeah. (nervous chuckle)
Whoa. Look at that.
Oops. Broke a window.
Better hope whoever lives here isn't the Seamstress! (chuckles)
Kidding. Come on, let's check it out. (whimpers)
(owl hoots)
Well, no one's home. We should probably just leave.
Come on, this place looks deserted.
Let's just run in and get the ball.
No one'll even know we were here.
(grunts)
I think someone's gonna know.
Ah, I'll fix it. Just find the ball.
Spooky! Nice.
Uh-huh. Now where could it be?
Ivy, look!
Sprig. Yes, you're right. These are very common.
I'll keep looking!
Found it. (gasps)
(sighs) Glad that's over wi--
Oh, my gosh.
Frog skins!
(grunts) (screams)
Sorry. We're so sorry. We're leaving. Ah! Hello. Sorry.
Fresh... skins.
(both scream) The Seamstress!
Sprig. We can't get away. We're gonna have to fight it.
Come on! But it's gross, and I don't wanna.
(grunting)
(screams, grunts)
Ivy! (shouts)
(Seamstress grunts)
(grunts) Huh?
Don't look. Don't look at me!
(gasps) She's a glass frog.
I've heard of this species.
They're born with translucent bodies.
(gasps) Sprig!
I know why she steals other frogs' skins.
What? Why? I don't follow.
Because she's not comfortable in her own skin.
Huh?
Aw.
Sprig, now!
(Ivy grunts) (Seamstress groans)
Let's burn this baby to the ground.
(grunts, screams)
(groans)
(roars)
(both laughing)
You look good without the hat. I mean it.
Aw, shut up, you. (giggles)
(both laughing)
And we never saw her again. The end.
What? That's the end?
I have so many questions. Didn't Ivy get bitten?
Is that thing still in the woods?
Hop Pop: Did any of those frog skins look like my friend Gabe? I haven't seen him in a while.
Sprig: Guys, seriously, everything's fine.
(knocking)
Who could that be? At this time of night? During the Shut-In?
I'll get it. (all) Sprig, no!
Ivy?
(all screaming)
(laughing) Huh?
We got you good.
And that is how you tell a scary story.
Yeah, seriously. That was good. Nice.
Yes, that was something we all enjoyed.
Ivy, that mask, it's not...
Nah, it's just burlap. Made it myself.
Well, that was fun, but I better get home.
Okay, just be careful out there.
And don't look at the moon.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I can't see a thing with this on. (chuckles)
Ooh! Sorry, sir. (chuckles)
Well, we better board this up. Wait, where's Polly?
That's weird. She was just here a second ago.
What if she slipped out while the door was open and ran off to look at the Blue Moon?
Hop Pop, you're overreacting.
"Dear Fam, I slipped out while the door was open
and ran off to go look at the Blue Moon."
What? Why would she do that?
"So that I can get my own scary story to tell.
Love, Polly."
Oh, that makes sense. Oh, crud.
We have to find her before she looks at the moon
and transforms into a hideous beast!
Polly! Where are you?
Kids! Get under the umbrella.
There she is. I see her.
Polly, no! Don't look!
(maniacal laughter)
Oh, no, the blue moon has possessed her!
(distorted maniacal laughter)
Nope. Not even a little.
Oh! What does this mean?
The legend must be false.
What a bummer. Now I have no scary story to tell.
Trust me, Polly.
Thinking a blue moon had actually got you
was way scarier than any of our stories tonight.
Really?
I had chills, dude.
A monster sister would be a nightmare!
My hair turned white. Oh, wait.
Aw, thanks, you guys.
All right, gang. Let's turn in.
(grunts, groans)
(grunting)
Huh? (grunting)
(howls)
What the...
Hmm. Works for me.
Hey, guys, guess what. The legend's true.
(all scream)
(Hop Pop) Nightmares are real!
(Sprig) Not a holiday. (Anne) Definitely not a holiday.
No! (all laughing maniacally)
(A bug with a rooster's face crows early in the morning. The camera cuts to Ivy's room and her alarm bug buzzes. Ivy jumps down from the ceiling.)
Ivy: Hi-yah! (She turns off her alarm bug.) Think you can sneak up on me, alarm bug? I've been awake for hours! (She goes to her hanger and jumps up to put on her hat. She then grabs a net and kicks her bedroom door open.) Boom! (Just as she is about to leave the house, Felicia grabs her net, stopping her.)
Felicia: Excuse me, young lady. Where do you think you're going?
Ivy: I'm meetin' Sprig for some Glitter Bug huntin'. I told you last night, remember?
Felicia: I remember saying you had to finish your chores first.
Ivy: Aww.
Felicia: Now let's see how good a job you did. (She picks up a plate.) Aha! What's this?
Ivy: A plate?
Felicia: (Showing a spot of dirt on the plate with a magnifying glass) A filthy plate! (She picks up a napkin swan.) And just look at these napkin swans. Their necks are looking pretty sad. (The napkin swan's neck droops.)
Ivy: Aw, come on, Mom. They're good enough.
Felicia: They most certainly are not! Now fix your shoddy work or you aren't goin' anywhere, young lady.
Ivy: But, Mom, I'm gonna be late!
Felicia: Up, bup, bup. Should have thought of that before you rushed your chores. (She hears knocking on the door.) Heavens! That'll be the morning rush! (She opens the door and some elderly frogs come in.) Come on in, everyone! My favorite time of day. Oh, Mr. Patterson, is that a new scarf? (Ivy groans with annoyance.)
(Meanwhile, Sprig is on a tree stump.)
Sprig: (clears throat) Hello, Ivy. Uh, how's it hanging, Ivy? Hmm. Oh, Ivy. Sorry, didn't see you there. (Suddenly, Ivy pops up from the tree stump, sending him flying.)
Ivy: Ambush!
Sprig: Hey, Ivy. I wasn't here talking to myself. That's for sure. (chuckles)
Ivy: Uh-huh. Well, sorry I'm late. My mom was on my case again. It's so annoying!
Sprig: I'm sure she's got her reasons.
Ivy: I guess.
(Anne and Polly pass by, doing fight moves.)
Anne and Polly: Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai!
Polly: We're Muay Thai-ing!
Sprig and Ivy: You're what?
Anne: It's a form of traditional Thai martial arts. My mom enrolled me in a class when she realized how high-spirited I was.
(We go to the past where Anne is banging on a pot with spoons as a toddler.)
Toddler Anne:  I'll tell you what I need
What I really, really need 
Mrs. Boonchuy: You know what Mommy really needs? You. Out of her kitchen. (speaks Thai) Txn ni! (Now!) (The flashback ends.)
Polly: Anne's gonna teach me some sweet moves. You guys wanna join?
Ivy: Aw, man, that sounds awesome. But Sprig and I can't. We're about to go Glitter Bug hunting.
Anne and Polly: Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai!
Ivy: Now, let's catch some bugs. (She takes Sprig's hand.)
Sprig: Okay!
(Ivy catches a Glitter Bug as it climbs a tree.)
Ivy: Gotcha.
Sprig: Nice one.
Ivy: So tell me more about your adventures on the road. I wanna hear all the details.
Sprig: (clears throat) Well, they really looked up to me in Bittyburg. And Ribbitvale was crazy ritzy, but I fit right in. (chuckles) I pretty much have friends in every town from here to Newtopia.
Ivy: Ah, your trip sounds amazing. Man, I've never even been out of Wartwood. (She puts the Glitter Bug she caught into Sprig's jar.)
Sprig: Well, next time I head out of the valley, maybe you can come with me. I mean if you want, no big deal.
Ivy: Heck, yeah, I do! (gasps) Check it out. (She points to a white Glitter Bug with colorful patterns. She and Sprig jump to the top of a tree.) All right, Sprig. Time for the super net. (She and Sprig combine their nets together, making a big net.)
Both: Aha! Ready? One, two, three...
(Suddenly, a bee-like phone creature appears and Felicia's voice is heard from it.)
Felicia: Ivy Sundew! (Ivy screams as she falls off the tree and lands with a faceplant. The Glitter Bug then flies away.)
Ivy: No! Come back!
Felicia: Ivy, you're late for your tea ceremony lessons.
Ivy: But, Mom, me and Sprig just got started!
Felicia: Don't "but, Mom" me. Come home this instant! (Ivy grunts angrily and punches the tree, knocking Sprig off it.)
Sprig: (dreamy) She's so cool.
(Meanwhile, Anne and Polly are about to do Muay Thai.)
Anne: Okay, listen well, my young pollywog. Muay Thai is all about...
Polly: (About to attack) Enough talk! (Just as she is about to hit Anne, she hits her.)
Polly: Ow. Wha... How did you...
Anne: You're too eager. My instructor always used to tell me: "Jai yen yen." It means to have patience and a cool heart.
Polly: Hi-yah! (Anne dodges her and she goes through the bushes and hits Wally.)
Wally: Ouch! (He appears from the grass carrying Polly.) Uh... totally wasn't watching. Nothing creepy going on here. Say, that looks like fun. Mind if I give it a try?
Polly: Ha. You? Good luck, Wallers. (Wally starts doing Muay Thai with Anne.) Huh?
Anne: Holy cow, Wally. You're pretty good at this. You see this right here, Polly? This is what you should be doing.
Polly: Hmm.
(At Ivy's house, Felicia is about to give her daughter her tea lessons.)
Felicia: First things first. We need to evaluate your attention to detail. Now, this was my table setting from this morning. And this was yours. (Ivy's table setting has a tea pot uncovered.)
Ivy: What's wrong with it? There's no difference!
Felicia: You're just missing that extra something-something. (She puts the cover over the tea pot.) It's the details that count, Ivy. Now, I'll demonstrate. Then you follow. We'll start with folding the swan napkins. (She folds a napkin into a swan and it sparkles. Ivy does the same thing, but it is different than hers.) We all have our off days, I suppose. (Ivy growls.) Next, let's steep the tea. (She spins some tea bags above tea cups. Ivy does the same thing, but one of her tea bags lands in one of the tea cups. Felicia clears her throat.) Careful. Don't break my frog china. (Ivy growls and steam comes out of her ears.) Oh, shoot, did I leave a kettle on? Oh, we'll deal with that in a bit. Now for my favorite part. Changin' the tablecloth! (She spins and places a tablecloth on a table. Ivy only puts hers halfway onto her table.) Ivy, if you're going to do things halfway, we'll just have to start over.
Ivy: That does it! I don't want to do any of this boring, frilly garbage. I wanna travel the world and have my own adventures.
Felicia: The only thing that's garbage is your attitude, young lady. A nice cup of oolong will cure that right up. (She pours some tea.)
Ivy: (shouts) Do you care about anything other than tea?! (She goes upstairs.) You just don't get me, Mom! (She slams her bedroom door, causing some tea china to fall off a shelf. Luckily, Felicia catches them with her arm, leg, and head and she growls. In Ivy's room,)
Ivy: (sighs) I've got to get out of here. (She looks at a poster that says "Adventure waits for no one.") Posters on my wall, are you trying to tell me something? (scoffs) Well, I can't just leave! There has to be another way! Well, it's hard to argue with that logic. (At the Plantar Farm, Sprig is shooting rocks with his slingshot in his room. Just as he shoots another rock, another one hits him in the head from behind.)
Sprig: Whoa. How'd I do that? Huh? Ivy?
Ivy: Come on, Sprig. You and I are leaving the valley. Tonight.
Sprig: Wha...
Ivy: You said you had friends in every town from here to Newtopia, right?
Sprig: Uh, yeah. But...
Ivy: Great. You can be my guide. Let's go!
Sprig: Aha! (grunting)
Ivy: Woo-hoo! Freedom. No more tea, no more swan napkins... just me, you, and the open road.
Sprig: (grunting) Ivy, hypothetically, what if I was exaggerating about how much of an out-of-valley expert I was?
Felicia: Ivy Hibiscus Matcha Sundew! (Ivy looks up and sees three bee-like phone creatures above.) You come home this instant! You're in big trouble, young lady. (One of the bee-like phone creatures lowers next to Ivy and she grabs it by the nose.)
Ivy: Oh, yeah, Mom?! Well, me and Sprig are runnin' away and leaving Wartwood for good! So there!
Felicia: You kids are in big trouble!
Ivy: (screams) Run! (She grabs Sprig by the arm and takes off.)
(shouts)
Anne: Not bad, Polly. But you still lack...
- (screams) - ...patience.
Polly: This is impossible! I'll learn how to fly before I learn...
- (grunts) - (screams)
Oh, hey, thanks.
Felicia: Ivy Sundew, I've had it with your disobedience!
Ivy: Well, I've had it with your nitpicking, your rules, and your tea lessons!
Felicia: (sighs) I can't believe I have raised such an ungrateful and disrespectful daughter!
Ivy: Oh, yeah? Well, then... maybe I don't even wanna be your daughter!
(all gasp)
Ivy: Sorry, it's just... I wanna see the world, you know? Get my hands dirty, learn martial arts, things like that.
Felicia: Martial arts, eh? Fine. You don't have to take tea lessons anymore, if you can beat me in a martial arts fight. Three rounds. And you only need to win one.
Ivy: Wha... Seriously? Me against you? (laughs) This is gonna be easy.
- (bell rings) - (Anne) Begin.
(shouts) Huh?
(all) Whoa.
Huh, must've been a lucky dodge. Here I come! (screams)
(shouts)
(growls)
Huh?
And Felicia gets the boop! Round one to Felicia!
Whoa. Where'd you learn those moves?
Oh, picked them up on my travels.
Travels? What travels?
Two for Felicia!
It's the third and final round. Whoever wins this, wins it all.
(shouts)
(shouts)
(grunting)
Tsk, tsk. Shouldn't have rushed in.
Now you're gettin' it.
(growls, sighs) Finish it.
- Fold the swan napkin. - Huh?
I said fold the swan napkin.
(chuckle) I got free, but-but...
- Now sift the tea. - What?
Sift... the... tea!
Now, Ivy, change the tablecloth.
(all gasp)
(gasps)
It's all right. Do it.
Round three to Ivy! Ivy wins! Whoo!
Mom, where did you learn those moves?
I was a little bit of an adventurer myself back in the day.
Where do you think my exotic selection of teas comes from?
Or my frog china?
I-I had no idea.
Ivy, you think I don't see you, but I do.
You want to travel the world, and I get it.
But you have to be patient, because it's dangerous out there,
and I just want you to be ready before we go.
(gasp) You don't mean...
Mm-hmm. All of these tea exercises were to prepare you
for when I take you on my next tea-gathering adventure.
(gasp) You're the best mom ever!
Mmm. I still can't believe you used to be some kind of world traveler.
(chuckles) Oh, honey. Where do you think I met your father?
Mom, please!
Well, I guess our work here is done.
To be honest, I have no idea what's going on.
Hey, have you guys seen Polly?
Gotcha!
You what? (groans)
That was technically your fault.
Eh, there's a good chance he won't remember this.
Polly: (chewing)
Anne: Yo guys! Check it out! I got a Mail-Fly message! Look how cute he is.
Mail-Fly: (buzzes)
Polly: (blows a raspberry) Jealous, I never get mail.
Sprig: Open it, open it!
Anne: It's from Marcy! She says we're ready to travel to the first temple.
Sprig: Alright!
Polly: Woo!
Anne: Ooh. She even included a checklist of things to bring. Let's see here. "Food. Weapons."
Sprig: Check!
Polly: Double check!
Sprig: Aah!
Polly: Jumpy little fella.
Anne: Cool, what else? "Armor." Armor?
Hop Pop: Got it covered! Believe it or not, I made each of you your very own suit of armor.
Sprig: Whoa!
Polly: Cool!
Anne: Seriously?
(The "suits" are actually massively inflated, limiting everybody's movements. Anne fall back onto the couch, unable to get back up.)
Anne: (grunts) I'm down! Anne's down!
Polly: Hop Pop! (groaning) This is the opposite of a suit of armor.
Hop Pop: Exactly. Less mobility means less trouble.
Polly: Yeah, yeah. Hey Anne, anything else on that list?
Anne: Oh yeah, just one more thing. "The Music Box!"
(Hop Pop then gets shocked for a second realizing about the music box)
Hop Pop: Uh, right, the music box. No problem. My contacts will have it ready by tomorrow.
Anne: Great! You're the best.
Hop Pop: (light chuckle)
Anne: All packed and ready to go. Ah! Too excited to sleep!
(footsteps)
Anne: Sounds like someone else can't sleep either.
Hop Pop: (grunting)
Anne: (giggles) Classic old Hop Pop bein' a freak. I'm gonna give that nerd a little scare.
Hop Pop: (gasps) I-it can't be. The music box. It's gone!
Anne: What?
(Hop Pop then sees Anne who was behind him and screams)
Hop Pop: Anne, what are you doin' here?
Anne: Did you just say...the music box is gone?
Hop Pop: I can't lie anymore! I buried the box here. And now it's missing!
Anne: Wait, what!? But you said your contacts were gonna--
Hop Pop: There were no contacts! I read the box was dangerous. I didn't know what to do! I panicked! You gotta understand. I was just trying to protect Sprig and Polly!
Anne: So you've been lying to me? This whole time?
Hop Pop: No! Well, yes, but... it's complicated!
Anne: No, it isn't! I need the music box to get home, and you buried it under a tree! What're you trying to do, keep me here forever? (gasps) That's it, isn't it? You sicko.
Hop Pop: No, no! I-it's not like that. I-it's just...I've lost so much already and--
Anne: Stop. (sighs, sniffs) Look, I can't be here right now.
Hop Pop: Anne!
Anne: Don't follow me. Don't! I see you!
Hop Pop: (sighs)
(the next day...)
Sprig & Polly: Quest, quest, quest! Quest, quest, quest!
Sprig: Hold up.
(Hop Pop looks overslept and miserable with a coffee mug in his right hand, looking at the window)
Sprig: Uh, Hop Pop, are you okay?
Hop Pop: (turns around) I really mucked it up this time, kids. (deep breath) I lied to Anne about the music box and I buried it under the tree out front.
Sprig & Polly: What!?
Hop Pop: (chuckle) Oh, it gets worse. When I went to dig it up last night, it was gone! Anne saw the whole thing and ran off. I've been waiting all night for her to come back.
Sprig: Look, Hop Pop, I don't know why you did what you did, but you gotta fix it.
Polly: Yeah! You gotta get out there and bring Anne back!
Hop Pop: You're right. I caused this mess, so dang it, I'm gonna clean it up! (slurps the cup and breaks it) And then I'm gonna clean that up.
Sprig & Polly: (sigh)
Polly: Well, this is a bummer.
Sprig: We gotta find that music box or Anne'll never forgive him.
Polly: Right on! Let's motor, bro-bro!
(whirring)
(cawing)
Hop Pop: Hmm. If there was only some clue as to which way she went--
(clink)
Hop Pop: A bobby pin? And hairbrush, mascara, sunglasses, teen magazine. I think I'm on the right track.
Anne: (yawn) Never thought I'd be sleepin' in this cave again. Not since the Plantars took me in. Well, at least I'll always have you, Rocky. Sweet, sweet dependable Rocky. Yeah, I just can't take you seriously with that hair.
Sprig: All right, maybe someone in town has seen the music box.
Sprig & Polly: Whoa.
Townsperson: My veggies!
Mayor Toadstool: Well, there goes the school money, Toadie.
Mrs. Croaker: Archie?
Sprig: Hey Maddie, what's going on?
Maddie: Someone dug a bunch of holes and stole stuff from everyone in town. I even lost a talisman that, if it fell into the wrong hands, would bring an end to all...living--I've said too much.
Polly: Who would dig a bunch of holes in the ground?
Soggy Joe: Holes in the ground, eh? And missing valuables too? Sounds like the work of the Magpie beetle.
Sprig: Never heard of it.
Polly: You gotta stop popping out of bushes, Soggy Joe.
Soggy Joe: The Magpie beetle is a rare breed of insect that lives underground. Every 20 years it burrows to the surface and steals junk to make its shell. It presents that shell to prospective mates in a ritual called the "love-nado dance."
Polly: Ew.
Soggy Joe: A spectacle much too dangerous to observe--You really should hear the rest of this!
Polly: On a mission!
Sprig: Thanks, Joe!
(squeaking)
Sprig: (panting)
Polly: Sprig, look! Soggy Joe was right. There's a burrow off to the side. Come on!
Sprig: Think this'll lead us to the box?
Polly: There's only one way to find out. (groans)
Sprig & Polly: (shouting)
Sprig: Where are we?
Polly: Oh no, Sprig! We're right smack dab in the middle of the love-nado! Maybe we should've listened to the end of Soggy Joe's thing.
Sprig: Okay, the music box has to be here somewhere. Whoa! We have to find it!
Sprig & Polly: Whoa!
Polly: (screams)
Sprig: (gasp) There it is!
(clinks)
Sprig: Alright, I'm goin' for it!
Polly: Wait! Sprig, no!
Sprig: Aah! (screams)
Polly: Sprig! Wait! No!
Anne: I thought I knew him, you know? But he was lying to me the whole time. Wish I had my bobby pins. (shouts) Oh. (scoffs) It's you. Go away.
Hop Pop: Please, Anne. Just let me explain.
Anne: I am not talking to you right now, Hop Pop. If that's even your real name. Oh, wait. Hop Pop's a nickname.
Hop Pop: I need you to know why I hid the music box. It's dangerous. I was just trying to protect the family.
Anne: Then why did you lie?
Hop Pop: Well, because...there's something I've never told you. Something hard to talk about. (sighs) The truth is...
(the moment stops as Anne and Hop Pop heard Polly and Sprig screaming)
Anne: That sounds like-
Hop Pop: Sprig! Polly!
(Anne and Hop Pop ran to see what's going on)
Anne: What the heck is this?!
Hop Pop: It's some kind of love monsoon.
Sprig & Polly: Help! Help!
Hop Pop: Anne, we have to work together.
Anne: Work with you? Not gonna happen. I'll save them myself! Whoa. Whoa!
(Anne tries to save them, jumping through Magpie beetles before slipping to a sad frog clown picture and hanging on to the top of Loggle's sculpture)
Hop Pop: (OS) Please, Anne. (onscreen) I know I lied to you, but trust me. At least long enough to save the kids.
Sprig & Polly: (screaming)
(Anne agrees as Hop Pop and Anne jumped through the beetles, Hop Pop releasing the tongue to stick on Anne's right arm and grabs on to it.)
Anne: (grunting) Sprig! Grab on!
(Sprig grabs Anne's hand while Polly grabs Sprig's hand)
Polly: (grabs the music box) Yoink. (screams)
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Hang on!
(Hop Pop starts to spin them around and like a grappling hook, they fly off back to the grass)
Anne: (panting)
(Anne grabs the music box and hugs it)
Sprig & Polly: Woo-hoo!
Polly: That was amazing!
Sprig: I can't believe we did it!
Anne: Yeah, we did. And now... (puts the music box in her backpack) we're through here.
(Anne starts to leave)
Sprig: Anne, no!
Polly: Where will you go?
Anne: I'll go stay with someone who isn't a liar. I don't know, maybe Loggle? He seems like a straight shooter.
Hop Pop: Anne, wait. Let me at least explain. What I did wasn't right. But I didn't do it to trick ya.
(Anne continues walking until...)
Hop Pop: (sigh) Sprig and Polly's parents.
(Anne stops walking as Polly and Sprig are shocked)
Polly: Hop Pop.
Sprig: That wasn't your fault.
Hop Pop: It was a few years ago. I was on a journey when the herons attacked Wartwood. Sprig and Polly survived. But their parents... weren't so lucky.
(a heron screeches)
(transition to the present)
Hop Pop: If I just had been there... I know things would've been different! Ever since then, I swore I'd never let my family down again. That I'd do anything to protect them. So when I found out the box was dangerous, I lied to you and hid it away. I thought I was protecting my family. But now I realize how foolish it was. You're my family too. And I've let you down. I let us all down. (starts breaking down in tears) I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm just so sorry!
(Anne, moved by this, walks to Hop Pop, and hugs him)
Hop Pop: Huh?
Anne: Hop Pop, I forgive you.
(they embraced)
Sprig: Reconciliation!
Polly: Frog pile!
All: (laughing)
Anne: Can we get out of this rain?
(the next day, it's sunny out after the rain)
Hop Pop: This book has been in our family for as long as I can remember. And look.
Sprig: Whoa.
Polly: Cool.
Anne: "Calamity Box"? Eesh. That does sound bad.
Hop Pop: Yeah. Not exactly comforting.
Sprig: I guess all we can do now is wait for Marcy.
Anne: Yeah. Guys, I hate to say it, but this temple quest may be more dangerous than we thought.
Hop Pop: Well, Anne, think this gang can handle it?
Anne: After today, I'm pretty sure this gang can handle anything.
(Anne and the Plantars embrace)
Polly: Awww.
(cut to the Plantar Farm)
Hop Pop (OS): You kids sure you don't wanna wear the puffy suits?
Sprig, Anne, & Polly (OS): Hop Pop.
Hop Pop (OS): Okay, okay, just had to ask.
Polly: (munching)
Anne: Who knew there was a bug that tastes just like chocolate? Why didn't anyone tell me sooner?
Polly: Hop Pop! You never let us have chocopede pancakes. What's going on?
Hop Pop: I thought you kids deserved a treat after, well...
Sprig: You lied and buried the music box, causing Anne to almost leave the family forever?
Anne & Polly: (gasp)
Hop Pop: (whimpers)
Sprig: Mm, boy am I glad Anne forgave you. Some people would carry the scars of that betrayal for life. Not you two, though. (laughs)
Polly: (elbows him) Sprig!
Sprig: What?
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm...I hope you like pancakes.
Anne: (chuckles)
Hop Pop: I-I-I made the batter from scratch, you know. Uh, been up since the crack of dawn, mixing.
Anne: Oh...great.
(bird shrieks)
Hop Pop: I'll get it!
Anne: Oh, thank frog.
(bird shrieks)
All: Huh?
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
Hop Pop: (screams) A monster bird, ridden by a pile of books! Wait, huh?
Marcy: (pops out of the book pile) Hiya, Plantar family!
All: Marcy!
Marcy: (falls) Aah!
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
Marcy: Big news, everyone. I finished my preparations for the--Whaa...Is this your house? Oh, it's so rustic and cute. When was it built? Third century? No. No, no, no. Second. Yes, of course. Okay, when it was af--
Anne: Hey, hey! Marbles. Big news?
Marcy: Oh, right. I finished my prep and we're ready for the first temple!
Anne: No way! Awesome!
Marcy: I just need to see the music box. Then it's go-time, gang. (She throws some punches.) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah-ya! (Sees everyone staring and stops.) Sorry, sorry. Long flight. A lot of pent-up energy. Anyway, music box.
Sprig: Good thing she didn't show up a few days ago, am I right?
Polly: You need to stop.
Anne: Here you go.
Marcy: (joints cracking) Okay, if my studies are correct, then...
(music playing, whirs)
All: Woah!
Marcy: There you go, bud.
Hop Pop: Oh, uh...(sighs) I better not.
Marcy: Hmm?
Anne: It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
Marcy: Well, we've got a big journey ahead. I'll explain everything on the way. Come on, Joe. Joe? (gasps) Joe Sparrow!
(cut to Joe Sparrow doing some funny moves to flirt with Bessie)
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
(Joe winks his eyebrows)
Bessie (blushes): (chirps)
Marcy: Leave that snail alone!
(Bessie leaves while still being blushed)
Marcy: Up you go!
Anne: Oop, pardon me. Pretty cramped up here, huh?
Hop Pop: Oh, uh, eh, so where do I sit?
Hop Pop: (screams)
Marcy: So, according to my research, these three ancient temple are filled with difficult challenges to keep out the unworthy. All we have to do is complete the challenges, and then we can charge the stone.
Anne: Nifty. So, what kind of challenges we talkin'?
Marcy: This first temple is said to specifically challenge your intelligence. So I'm pretty sure it's full of puzzles. No frog, toad or newt in history has been able to survive it.
All: Uh...
Marcy: But don't worry, because none of them were Marcy Wu, head of the chess club, master RTS player, straight-A student, except for gym but only because I was reading in class, which only proves my point!
Anne: That's all great, Marcy, but be careful. When you get this into something, you tend to tune everything else out.
(Flashback to where Marcy is playing a game reminiscent of Flappy Bird on her game console while pulling down a frozen yogurt lever.)
Marcy: Oh my gosh, Anne. I'm about to beat my all-time record!
(The camera pans to show the ice cream overflowing while Anne tries frantically to clean it up.)
Anne: I'm so happy for you!
(Cut to another scene, where Sasha, Anne, and Marcy are doing a school play. Anne is swinging from a rope while Marcy is playing with her game console backstage.)
Anne: Marcy! (screams) Let me down! Marcy! Help!
(The rope breaks causing Anne to fall into the audience.)
(Cut to Anne's room, where she is laying on her bed eating marshmallows while listening to the news.)
News Reporter: Breaking news, 500 snakes have escaped from--Wait, is that a middle school student?
(Camera pans to Marcy obliviously walking towards the snakes.)
Anne: Marcy! No!
(Flashback ends)
Anne: That was the worst Saturday of my life.
Marcy: That's called being in the zone, Anne. It's pretty much my superpower.
Anne: (sighs) Okay, okay. Just don't forget about us. This place is gonna be dangerous, and we're here to help.
Marcy: Oh, please! Like I could forget you guys. Penny? Sprout?
Polly: Polly.
Sprig: Sprig.
Marcy: Look, the point is, I'm not gonna let you guys down.
Hop Pop: You know, I wouldn't mind being let d--(screaming, grunting) I'm upside down.
Marcy: Welcome to Amygdala Woods, everyone, home to the first temple.
All: Whoa.
Hop Pop: Little help here?
Sprig: Whoa! What are these things?
Marcy: Gyromitra esculenta. Also known as brain mushrooms.
Anne: A forest full of brains for the intelligence temple? Kinda on the nose, don't you think?
Polly: Speaking of temples, I think you way overhyped this place.
Marcy: No, no, no. That's the temple.
All: (gasp)
(wind whistling)
Sprig: So what's this then? Outhouse. It's an outhouse.
(buzzing)
Marcy: All right, guys! Let's do this thing! (echoing)
Anne: Oop, sorry about that. After you, dude.
Hop Pop: Oh, no, no, no. A-After you, my dear.
Anne: (chuckles) Oh, don't be silly. I insist.
Marcy: Those two seem a bit off.
Hop Pop: No, I insist.
Marcy: Did something happen?
Sprig & Polly: Don't ask.
All: Wow.
Polly: Wow.
(clicks)
Polly: Uh-oh.
Marcy: Did I learn an entire dead language just for today? You better believe I did! Now, let's see. "Keeper of the box, one strong of mind, three trials await, that will return the stones' shine." Hey, looks like there's three trials, guys. And here we go.
(wind howling)
Sprig: A dead end. Well, we tried our best and that's what counts.
Marcy: Hey, come on. There's a puzzle here somewhere. Everyone, look for clues.
Anne: (chuckles) Hey, guess who found the puzzle? Whoa! Whoa!
Hop Pop: (gasps) Frog, help us. A cursed cube possessed by evil magic.
Marcy: No, it's the puzzle! Also, I'm pretty sure that's a magnetic field holding her up.
Hop Pop: Isn't that what I said?
Anne: Well, whatever it is, all yours, Marbles. (grunts, screams)
Marcy: Whoa, this thing's got, like, a zillion permutations. If this temple thinks it can beat me, it's got another thing coming.
All: (groan)
Polly: Uh...guys?
All: (grunt, screaming)
Sprig: Anyone else tasting chocopede pancakes right about now?
Anne: Marcy! Can you at least let us know what you're gonna move before you move it?
All: Whoa! (screaming)
Hop Pop: (screams)
Sprig: (screams)
Anne: Marcy!
Marcy: Ha! Got it!
All: (scream, groan)
Marcy: We did it! One down, two to go. (laughs) How fun is this? Yeah! (laughs) Whoo!
Polly: Wow, Anne, you weren't kidding about her being in the zone.
Hop Pop: Not to mention she's a tad overconfident.
Sprig: Hard to argue with the results though.
Anne: Ugh!
Anne: Oh, hey, a dance floor!
Marcy: Not quite. Watch.
Sprig: Woah. Not getting good vibes from this room.
Polly: Welp. Time to turn back. Thanks for playing, everyone!
Hop Pop: Hold on, gang. Look!
Marcy: "A dangerous room. What to do? Don't be jealous of my hue."
All: Huh?
Sprig: Who's Hue?
Marcy: Hmm. I wonder...
Anne: Okay, so pink is death by flame, blue is death by crushing. I'm still not following--Marcy!
Marcy: Doot doot doot doot dooot do!
All: (scream)
Marcy: (grunts)
Anne: (sighs)
Marcy: Ha! Solved it. Okay guys, listen up. Green is the safe color. Get it?
All: Eh...
Marcy: "Don't be jealous of my hue." It's a reference to green, the color of envy.
Sprig: Ah, yes, naturally.
Polly: Hmm...swell.
Hop Pop: I have a lot of green friends who would find that offensive.
Polly: But why hasn't the door opened then?
Marcy: Hmm. Looks like this is a two-person job. Someone go stand on the other green square.
Anne: Mar-Mar, are you...sure?
Sprig: Yeah, how do we know that one isn't some kind of trapdoor?
Polly: With spikes in it!
Hop Pop: Not helping, Polly.
Marcy: Guys, I've done the research. Plus, it's me, remember? I said I won't let you down and I meant it. Now, who wants to hit that button?
Anne: Hmm...
Anne & Hop Pop: I'll do it!
Hop Pop: Excuse me?
Anne: Huh?
Hop Pop: Anne, no. I'll do it. The whole point of this is to get you home alive. I've already had a good life.
Anne: No, Hop Pop. I'll step on the tile. This is my quest. It's my responsibility. Your responsibility is keeping your family safe, not me.
Sprig: Uh-oh.
Hop Pop: I care about you too, Anne.
Anne: I mean, to an extent, right? You kinda proved that when you buried the music box.
Hop Pop: Now, hold on. That's unfair.
Anne: Listen, Hop Pop, when push came to shove, you made a choice. It's fine. But let's stop pretending I'm part of the family, okay?
Hop Pop: Hmph. (croaks)
Marcy: Uh...everything okay over there? Can someone please hit the button?
Hop Pop: Gladly. And a-one and a-two--(screams)
Anne: (grunts)
Polly: Careful, girl!
Sprig: Anne!
All: (scream)
Anne: Whoa! (screams, chuckles, gasps)
Marcy: Whoo! What did I tell ya? This temple is toast! Consider the stone charged, baby! (hums)
Polly: Dang, girl!
Anne: I think I lost an eyebrow.
Polly: Cool!
Hop Pop: Hmph.
Marcy: (gasps) This leads to the top floor. That means there's only one puzzle left. Come on, team!
Hop Pop: Anne, I told you I was gonna step on that tile.
Anne: And I told you I didn't want you to.
Sprig: Hey, we kinda need to be a team in here so we don't die, so....
Hop Pop: I don't understand, Anne. I thought you forgave me.
Anne: Yeah? Well, maybe I spoke too soon.
Hop Pop: Spoke too soon?
Polly: What do we do, Marcy? This is fun to watch and all, but it could make the last puzzle pretty rough.
Marcy: I'm sure they'll work it out by the time we get there.
Hop Pop: Give me a break.
Polly & Sprig: Hmm...
(One hour later titlecard)
Hop Pop: So there's nothing I can do to fix this? Not one thing?
Anne: Nothing's coming to mind!
Sprig: Man, this is a long hallway. (grunts)
Marcy: Ha! Here we are. The final puzzle.
Anne & Hop Pop: (arguing)
Marcy: Oh! I'm so excited.
(arguing continues)
Marcy: Guys, killing the vibe. Thank you. Now, where was I? "Few have the brains to make it to this door, but are you wise enough to solve what's in store?" Yep! Let's go.
Hop Pop & Anne: Hmph.
Marcy: (gasps) I don't believe it! It's flipwart!
Anne: (gasps) What's flipwart?
Marcy: It's a strategy game I learned to play in Newtopia. It's like chess but to the max. I got so good at it, I even beat King Andrias.
Hop Pop: Impressive. They say King Andrias is one of the best flipwart players around.
Marcy: So, both sides have a wart, right? And they're trying to flip it! Each piece has a different set of abilities. These archers, for example, can only attack in a straight line. Oh, I love this game!
Hop Pop: Hmm. Hey, Marcy, what does this say?
Marcy: "Any commander whose wart falls may never set foot inside these temple walls." Looks like you only get one shot at this. One shot is all I need. But first, to set up the board...
Sprig: Well, I guess we'll just sit back quietly and watch.
Polly: Yeah, it'll be nice to sit this one out cause these flippas be tired. (screams)
All: Polly!
Marcy: A giant flipwart board?
Sprig: Polly, are you okay?
Polly: "Okay"? I've got a sword, baby! I'm doing better than all of you.
Anne: Marcy, do you think we should stop? This could get dangerous.
Marcy: We don't have a choice, Anne. You wanna get home, right? Then we've gotta play or we'll never recharge the stone.
Hop Pop: She has a point.
Anne: I didn't ask you, Hop Pop.
Marcy: Trust me, okay?
Anne: (sighs) Okay. I hope you know what you're doing.
Hop Pop & Sprig: (scream)
Hop Pop: Ooh, I get a scepter.
Polly: (chuckles) You're a pawn.
Sprig: Aw, man.
Marcy: Get ready, Anne. There's a good chance you're next.
Anne: Oh, looks like I'm not in the game. Well, you guys have fun, I guess. (screams)
Hop Pop: Wait, what?
Sprig: Anne, no!
Polly: Traitor!
Anne: No, this is good. I'll just play badly and sabotage the other team. Didn't think of that, did ya, temple? Ha! Here we go. Sabotage! (groans) Okay, I can't move.
Sprig: Anne? What's going on?
Hop Pop: Our hands are tied, literally.
All: (straining)
Marcy: Don't worry, everyone. I'll just play well enough so that none of you gets hurt. It'll be like hard mode! (chuckles) Fun!
Sprig: You wouldn't be saying that if you were the pawn.
Marcy: Okay, white goes first, so it's our move. Let's flip this wart!
Sprig: You got this, bud.
Marcy: Now, let's see how they respond.
Anne: Pfft!
Sprig: I don't like this game!
Marcy: (scoffs) Such a basic response. This is gonna be easy.
All: (gasp)
Polly: (laughs)
Sprig: Whoa! Phew.
Anne: (grunts)
Polly: (screams)
All: (panting)
Marcy: Gotta admit, this temple's good, but not good enough. Gotcha! We win!
Wart: (chuckles, taunts)
Marcy: Huh?? What? No! Guys, this thing cheats!
All: (gasp)
Anne: Hop Pop, look out!
Hop Pop: Huh? (screams)
Anne: (grunts, straining)
Hop Pop: (grunting) Man, what a day.
Sprig: Hop Pop! Marcy, do something!
Marcy: All right, so what if it cheats? Still not enough to beat me.
Hop Pop: (screams)
(thuds)
Marcy: I still have way more pieces. If I can just attack from a different angle, I should be fine. (nervous chuckle)
Hop Pop: (screams, grunts) Oh, I bet you're loving this, ain't ya?
Anne: What? No! I might be mad at you, but I don't wanna hurt you!
Hop Pop: Well, you're already hurtin' me. Every time you remind me of the mistakes I made, every time you rub it in my face that I let you down. I mean, what's it gonna take for you to let this go?
Anne: Hop Pop, I... I...
Hop Pop: Just tell me and I'll do it. Anything!
Anne: I don't know!
Marcy: Huh?
Anne: I just need time. Look, I want things to go back to the way they were. But--but-- (sobs)
Hop Pop: I'm sorry, Anne. You take all the time you need. Maybe it's enough to admit we still got issues, instead of pretending they don't exist.
Anne: (sniffs) I think that'd be good. I'd hug you except, you know, magical restraints.
Sprig: (sobbing) He had a family! He had a family!
Polly: (screaming)
Marcy: What am I doing?
Anne: No, no, no, no, no!
Hop Pop: (screams)
Marcy: No! Hop Pop, Anne! Who cares about this stupid game? I forfeit! (grunts) It's not working! Maybe I have to flip the big wart too. (grunts)
(alarm blaring)
Marcy: (grunts, screams)
Sprig: What the heck's going on?
Marcy: I'm trying to throw this game, but it won't let me! I need your help.
Sprig: Help you? How? (screams)
Marcy: (grunts)
Sprig: (screaming, grunts)
Wart: (squeals)
Marcy: (panting, groans)
Anne: Whoa!
Sprig: (coughs)
Anne: (coughs)
Polly: Ow.
Anne: Marcy? Marcy, I don't understand.
Hop Pop: Yeah, why'd you throw the game?
Marcy: Because it wasn't worth you guys getting hurt. I got so caught up in proving I was smart enough to win, I couldn't see what I was about to lose.
Sprig: Well, in your defense, that game was a ding dang cheat!
Polly: Yeah! I still think you're pretty smart. A little obsessive, though.
Marcy: Thanks, Sprig, Polly.
(the temple then shows the exit sign)
Marcy: I got it, temple. I wasn't smart enough to win, but I can find the exit, okay?
Hop Pop: (groans)
Anne: Need a ride, old-timer?
Hop Pop: I'm not that old. But, yes, thank you.
Anne: Guess we won't be charging the stone today, huh?
Marcy: No. And since I lost, I'm not allowed back in the temple. You guys will have to try it all again without me.
Anne: We'll manage, dude. Somehow.
Polly: Hey, guys. The failure arrow wants us to keep going this way.
Marcy: (sighs) Well, if we're gonna lose, might as well lose all the way.
Sprig: What? The outhouse?
Marcy: Wait a second.
All: (gasp)
Polly: What's that?
Marcy: No. It can't be. Guys, this is where we charge the stone!
All: Huh?
Hop Pop: But we failed! Uh, I wouldn't recommend touching that.
All: (gasp)
Marcy: "Only the worthy will have the wisdom to choose whether it's more important to win, or have the humility to lose. A choice was made to save thy friends and, honestly, doesn't that make you a winner in the end?"
Anne: That last bit was oddly casual!
Marcy: Of course! Why didn't I think of it sooner? The temple wasn't just testing for intelligence. It was also testing for humility!
Polly: Well don't give the temple a chance to change it's mind. Charge that bad boy!
All: (gasp)
Anne: We did it?
Marcy: We did it!
All: Yay! (screaming)
Marcy: Guys, it's leading us to the next temple!
Anne: That's good.
Hop Pop: Thank goodness.
Sprig: Thank frog!
Marcy: I should be able to triangulate its location with a bit of work. (inhales) Whoo! This just keeps getting better!
Anne: All right! One down, two to go! Ow!
Hop Pop: Oh, Anne, uh, whoops, I, uh--
Anne: Hop Pop, it's totally fine. It hurt, but I know you didn't mean to, and I want you to know that I'm really not mad about it.
Hop Pop: Well, thank you, Anne. And I want you to know that I will make an effort to be more careful about where I walk because--
Sprig: Hey, uh, can we leave now?
Polly: Yeah, this is uncomfortable to watch.
Anne & Hop Pop: We're working on it!
Marcy: Hey, you guys wanna go straight to the next temple tonight, or take a break first?
All: Break, please.
Marcy: Fair enough.
Yunan: The political situation is worsening, Your Highness. What started as a small valley riot is quickly becoming something more. Not only that, the toad lords have agreed to meet. This could spell disaster.
Andrias: How disappointing.
Yunan: And the traitor, Grime, is still at large and is currently being aided by a--aah!
Andrias: (laughs) Why, it's a message from Marcy. Looks like they're making progress. That's enough for now, Yunan. I'll handle the rest.
Yunan: Sire?
(It's morning in Wartwood, and Marcy (who's staying in the fwagon) kicks the door open full of energy.)
Marcy: Woo! Look out Amphibia! It's Marcy's first day in Wartwood!
(She rushes down to the basement fists in the air, where Anne's shown still asleep.)
Marcy: First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood!
(She leaves.)
Anne: (asleep) Five more minutes.
(Marcy's now flying over town on Joe Sparrow.)
Marcy: First day! First day! First day! First day! Woo!
(The two land.)
Marcy: (gasps) It's so cute! It's got a folksy country vibe.
Random frog: (burps)
Marcy: Colorful characters.
Three random frogs: (burps)
Marcy: Gosh, Anne was right. It's the perfect little farm town! (The frog captured by the dragonfly flies over and burps in the background.) And now, to introduce myself.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, those look fresh.
Marcy: Hi! My name is Marcy. What's your name?
Mrs Croaker: Oh, great. Just what we need. Another outsider. (walks off)
Marcy: (waves to the merchant) Hello!
(The merchant closes down his stand.)
Marcy: HI there! My name is Marcy. Do you have any time to talk about its unique architectural history?
Maddie's Sisters: Uh...
Baby Sister #2: Are you a weirdo?
(Wally is shown playing his accordion on a barrel.)
Marcy: Oh, my gosh! Are you a vagrant? Is that an accordion? Is that eye really gone?
Wally: Too many questions!
(He throws his accordion through a window and jumps through it. Marcy sighs. A bit later, Marcy sits at the statue in the middle of town when Anne walks up to her.)
Anne: Hey, Mar Mar. How's your first day in Wartwood going?
Marcy: Oh, great. Did you know this entire town is built on top of a swamp but never sinks? That's because the designers knew exactly how heavy to make everything.
Anne: That's a cool fact. (blushes) What else ya learn?
!Marcy |I also learned that small communities like this don't take kindly to strangers which mean's idon't have a chance. |-
!Anne |Don't be ridiculous of course, they'll accept you. |-
!Marcy |You sure about that? (points to an angry mob next to her) |-
!Anne |Guys, come on she's with me. |-
!Random frogs |All right if you say so. |-
!Anne |Wait, is that Polly? |-
!Polly |I go where the mob goes, Anne! |-
!Marcy |Hmm... |-
!Anne |They will warm up to you, it just takes time. |-
!Marcy |Time or maybe a strategy. |-
!Anne |Gonna say time still. |-
!Marcy |Come on in people are just another puzzle to solve, operation connect with wartwood engage, whoa whoa |-
!Random frog #1 |What the, the town founder whose name I don't even know, how dare she. |-
!Random Frog #2 |It's that clumsy outsides. |-
!Frog #3 |Will knock the whole city down before she's through. |-
!Marcy |No problem, no problem, I can fix it. |-
!Mrs. Croaker |Whoa, she fixed it. |-
!Anne |Whoa, when did you learn how to do that? |-
!Marcy |I took a sculpting class in Newtopia. |-
!Anne |You've been taking classes? |-
!Marcy |Yeah, haven't you? |-
!Random frog |Where are you? |-
!Female frog |You seem all right lady, for an outsider anyway, (spit) |-
!Marcy |Oh my gosh Anne, I just got a spit of approval, hmm... I did win the Newtopia over by improving their city, I bet I could do the same thing here in wartwood. |-
!Anne |I guess that can work. |-
!Marcy |Come on Anne, show me all the cruddy things to wrong with this town. |-
!Anne |Where do I even start? |-
(They start by filling potholes. They fill two, but a frog falls into the one behind them.)
Marcy: Should've started with that one.
Polly: This is so great! Our first day in forever with no responsibilities! So, what are we gonna do?
Hop Pop: Ha! You'll see.
(Hop Pop soon stops in front of the seed store.)
Polly: Oh, no!
Hop Pop: Yep!
Polly: Oh, come on! Don't worry, Marcy. We don't have to go into the boring old-
Marcy: This is so cool. A store just for seeds? Boy, we could be there for hours!
Hop Pop: Don't tempt me!
Marcy and Hop Pop: (laughs)
Marcy: The humble seed. So much potential for growth!
Hop Pop: One of the rare things life where you actually get out what you put in! It's beautiful! (laughs as he and Marcy head to the store)
Anne: Have fun in there!
Sprig: Yeah, we're good here in the wagon.
Hop Pop: Oh, and look after Polly you two.
(door shuts)
Polly: Perfect. Now that the nerds are gone, you guys want to go make mischief? Guys?
(game plays)
Polly: Hey! Did you hear me?
Anne: You know, in the past, I would have said yes, but I think I'm getting a little too old for that nonsense.
Sprig: Sorry, Polly. But me and Anne have changed. We're different now.
Anne: Some of us even sound different.
Sprig: What?
Anne: Nothing. Anyway, I think we should focus our energy on more mature activities. Sprig! Use your kitty cat blasters!
Sprig: On it!
(zaps)
Polly: So no one wants to cause trouble with me?
Anne: Sorry, dude. And if case you didn't hear, we're responsible for you.
Polly: Boo!
Anne: You'll get it one day, when you have someone to look after.
Polly: Death first!
Game: You're dead!
Sprig: Dang it!
Polly: You two are responsible for me, huh? So I guess that means that you're responsible for this!
(seeds clattering)
Employee: What the-
(door opens)
Employee: Who's responsible for this?
Polly: They are!
Employee: Yous two! Get over here and clean this up!
Sprig: We're sorry!
Anne and Sprig: Sorry, sorry, sorry!
(birds peck at seeds, Anne and Sprig)
Anne: Not the eyes, not the eyes!
(laughs) Later, losers.
(clucking) (screams)
No, no, no, no!
(giggling)
Pssh! Who needs those two?
Hmm, now, how can I be rambunctious to the max?
(giggles)
People of Wartwood,
welcome to the splash zone.
(screams)
- Hmm?
Polly: Aw. Really thought that splash would be bigger. Hmm. (gasps)
Mmm. Beetle pie.
(straining)
Argh! Curse these puny arms.
(screams, grunts)
(sighs) Mischief's no dang fun alone. Stupid Anne. Stupid Sprig. (grunts)
Hmm.
(gasps)
What the heck? Is somebody in there?
(screams, grunts)
(gasps)
Oh, my frog! A monster! Stay back!
Huh? Ha! You clown. You're copying me.
(laughs)
(distorted laugh)
Whoa, your laugh is horrifying. I love it! You're no monster. You're just a big tadpole. I'm Polly, by the way. What's your name?
Can't talk, huh? You really are a baby.
(grunting)
You look like one of those things from the fighting game on Anne's phone. What was it called? A Robo. Except you're more like a frog. (gasps) I will call you Frobo.
(laughs) I know, I know. I'm a genius. So what else can you do?
(slurps) (squawks)
(gargles, spits) No more for me, thanks.
Whoa! (chuckles)
I don't believe this. I have my own frog dang sidekick. Frobo, how'd you like to have some fun?
Ooh, pie.
Hey, Frobo, grab that beetle pie for me.
(screams) Oh, hey, it's cherry.
Run, Frobo!
Hey, check this out.
(grunts) Whoo-hoo! Ha!
Whoo! Your turn.
Oh, a bit of, uh, property damage there. (giggles)
(sirens wailing) Oh, shoot!
Frobo, it's time to fro-go!
(groans)
(laughs)
(laughs)
(laughing) Whoo!
(laughs)
- Hello? - (blares)
You thinking what I'm thinking, Larry?
On three. One, two, three.
(both) Giant octopus! Case closed.
That's why you and I are partners, Larry.
The best ever.
Whoo!
I don't know what Anne was so worried about.
Taking care of someone is easy.
All right, Frobo. Time to enter the splash zone.
(laughs)
Come on, buddy. Your turn.
This might've been a mistake.
(screams)
(screams)
(groans)
Oh, no!
- (glass shatters) - (sobs) No!
Hey! Can't a guy try a new hairstyle in peace?
(gasps) Sweet sassy molassy.
What is that?
It's some kind of hulking monster.
Good gravy. Look at that.
Well, whatever it is, it destroyed the fountain.
Second time this week too.
It's some kind of metal abomination.
No, no! He's not dangerous.
He's just a big, sweet dum-dum.
Frobo, show them. Do a trick.
- (all screaming) - Gadzooks.
Quick! We gotta destroy it.
(townspeople clamoring)
No, wait! Stop!
I told you he was harmless. Now, back off.
Oof!
Wow, you really kicked me there.
Oh, whoops. Sorry, Polly.
Welp, that don't look good.
(roars)
No!
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(all screaming)
Finally, done cleaning up. Now let's find Polly.
(all screaming)
Wha... What is that thing?
Is that some kind of crazy frog robot?
Uh, maybe. (all scream)
Well, whatever it is, we've got to stop it before it hurts anyone.
(screams) No, wait! Guys!
(trembling)
(Anne) Hey, you!
(screams)
(grunts)
(grunting)
Hey, put her down, you big... (grunts)
Tha... That all you got?
(both gasp)
Hang in there, kids.
Frobo, no!
(all exclaiming)
(both gasp)
No! Everybody stop!
Frobo, I know you're just trying to protect me.
Everything you did today
was because I asked you to.
And now I'm asking you to stop.
Po... Po... Polly.
(gasps) Frobo, your first words.
Well, now that it's calmed down, let's tear this thing apart!
Never!
Come on, Toadstool,
isn't there another way?
It seems like Polly really likes him.
Anne, I know this town
is no stranger to crazy at this point...
- But come on. - This Frobo thing is a menace.
It destroyed my shack. I mean, someone's gotta answer for this mess.
(sighs) You're right. I will.
This wasn't Frobo's fault. It was mine.
I taught him how to do all of this.
I'm sorry about the damage.
I'll do whatever it takes to fix it all up.
But leave Frobo alone. He's innocent.
Frobo, say you're sorry.
So... Sorry.
It said sorry and I suppose that's good enough for me, eh.
We don't even have handcuffs that big anyway.
(groans) I guess we already accepted two monsters.
Yep. I mean, what's one more at this point?
(chuckles) I can't believe they had tomato plant seeds.
I still think you shouldn't have bought those.
- Wha... What in tarnation? - (gasps)
Hey, Hop Pop.
Oh, my gosh! Is that a robot?
Where did it come from? What is it made of? Can I have one?
What's a robot? Too hard to explain.
So, I know this is a lot to take in,
but can we please keep him?
I'll be his big sister.
I'm ready to take care of someone.
Whoa! Wow, what a turn around.
Uh, I'm not sure, Polly.
It sure seems dangerous.
I mean, can it do anything useful?
Show 'em, Frobo.
(beeping)
Ooh! Welcome to the family, Mr. Frobo.
So, do anything else?
(chuckles) (cheers)
Don't mind if I do. Hey!
It's multigrain.
Wow! First underground computers and now a robot? Wait a second.
Sprig, you don't think that thing was what got built in the ruins of disaster, do you?
No way! And followed us all the way home?
That would have been hundreds of miles.
Could be. (both) Hmm.
(rooster crows)
Mayor Toadstool: (inhales) Ah... Just breathe in that country air, Toadie. I can't believe I'm saying it, but this town's kinda growing on me.
Toadie: Okay, sir. Item one, there are some potholes that need filling, but the money we have left is supposed to buy us that (whispering) swanky new Jacuzzi.
Toadstool: Hmm... You know what, Toadie? You go ahead and fill those holes.
Toadie: Who are you, and what have you done with my beautiful Mayor?
Toadstool: Get a hold of yourself, Toadie. Since we saved a couple of lives at Toad Tower, people have been seeing me a little differently. And, well, frog dang it, it's rubbing off on me.
(man grunts)
There we go.
(grunts)
Toadie, grab the other side.
(grunting)
(sighs) Thanks, Mayor.
- Good ol' Mayor. - We didn't vote for him, but he turned out okay.
(growls)
What?
Jacinda: Mayor Toadstool I presume? I am Jacinda, official emissary of Newtopia. We have come to discuss... the events of Toad Tower.
Why, sure. I may have been to Toad Tower that day. But I had nothing to do-
-Enough prattle. Let's get right to... the point.
(fanfare)
Jacinda: By order of Newtopia, I hereby decree that Mayor Froderick Toadstool has been appointed the new Head Toad of Toad Tower.
- (noisemakers whistle) - (both gasp)
Jacinda: With Captain Grime gone, we need someone we can trust. And from what we've heard, you're the toad for the job.
(choir singing)
(gasps) Frog in heaven.
Jacinda: Right... A lot of money. Even had to dodge some bandits to get it here safe and sound. (chuckles) Anyway, this money is for rebuilding Toad Tower. But who's to say that's all it's for, hmm? (chuckles) So pack your bags. We leave at sundown.
Mayor Toadstool: Wait, leave? As in leave Wartwood?
Jacinda: Uh, yeah. You didn't think we were gonna build the tower here, did you?
Mayor Toadstool: (chuckles) Yeah, hypothetically, what would happen if I refused?
Jacinda: You'd find yourself rotting in one of (voice lowers) the deepest, dankest dungeons in all of Amphibia. (normal voice) Hypothetically.
Toadie: He accepts. He accepts!
Jacinda: Great. The job is yours. Pending an evaluation. Toodles.
Sir! What in frog's name are you doing?
A gig like this is all you've wanted.
Look at our vision board.
Look at it!
I know. I know it's crazy,
but wouldn't you miss this place?
We are not having this conversation.
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go pack all 800 pairs of your silk pajamas.
(townspeople chattering)
- (slams) Anne: Yo, Toadstool! Hop Pop sent me to ask about these parking tickets. (Grunts as she lugs in a chest filled to the brim with tickets.) He says he wasn't even in town on these days.
Boonchuy, did you ever work your entire life to fulfill a dream, but when it finally comes true, you realize that maybe it wasn't your dream?
Uh... we still talking about parking tickets?
I've just been appointed the Head Toad of Toad Tower. All I have to do is leave this crummy town and never look back. It's everything I've ever wanted! So why do I feel so down?
Maybe you've come to love this crummy town more than you thought you would. I certainly relate.
I just wish there was a way out of this.
Well, back home, whenever Mom asked me to do chores, I'd do a really bad job so she wouldn't ask me anymore.
That's it! I've just gotta convince them I'm the wrong toad for the job. You gotta help me. No one's more incompetent than you.
Not happening.
You leave me no choice. Prepare yourself for the cutest thing you've ever seen. (Whimpers and puts on puppy dog eyes.)
Anne: (reacts in disgust) Okay, okay, I'll help. Just never make that face again. First, we're gonna need some backup.
Lead the way, kid.
All right. I've come up with two ways that this can go. Number one, make the Mayor look like a coward. Number two, make him look incompetent.
Is there a third option?
No. Any questions?
- Kind of. - Several.
What's the sitch with the parking tickets?
Polly: Hey, shouldn't we get Marcy and Frobo in on this?
Anne: No can do. Marcy said she wanted to spend the day studying Frobo. Wonder how that's going.
(Cut to a small shack where a charging sound is heard from within. Suddenly, an explosion occurs inside as smoke begins to emerge.)
Marcy: (coughing) Fascinating.
Anne: Don't worry. We can do this.
All it takes is teamwork and coordination.
(cheers)
(all grunt)
This is our farmer's market.
It ain't much, but it's our pride and joy.
Give me all your coppers, old frog.
And make it snappy.
Mayor Toadstool, help.
No can do, random farmer,
for I am but a lowly coward.
I guess I'll just hand over all my hard-earned coppers.
(grunts)
Anne and Sprig?
Why in tarnation are you robbing your own stand?
I can explain. No need. I get it.
You distracted the robbers long enough for the muscle to show up.
You're truly Head Toad material.
Well, that didn't work.
Don't worry. We still got the second option.
No talking.
And here's the fence I had built
to keep those burrowing moles
from getting into Wartwood.
- Fence? But they burrow, right? - What's your point?
Come on, kids. Herd those moles.
I'm just saying a fence might not keep them out.
And I'm say... (screams) (growls)
(screams)
(screams) I really thought that bad idea would work.
(shouts, grunts)
Incredible. What a show of strength.
Truly, we've made the right choice. (chuckles)
- (whispering) - Any other ideas? - Nope.
- We're sunk. - Well, then it looks like I have no choice.
I better finish packing. (grunts)
No need, sir.
We're all packed and ready to go.
You've got a competent assistant here, Mayor.
-Too bad he's about to be out of a job, -Excuse me.
Did you think you were going to be assistant to the Head Toad?
(chuckles) Adorable. But no.
I, Jacinda, will be Toadstool's deputy at Toad Tower.
(screams)
(gasps) Toadie? Now see here.
I've got something to say to you, and I don't care if I go to prison for it.
Oh. I'm all ears.
(gulps) Truth is...
The truth is...
- (bugle sounds) - (shouting)
Where do you think you're going?
What could it mean?
(chuckle)
Fens? And uh, uh... the creepy one.
- Mire. - Right. Him.
Oh, no. That means...
(grunts)
Greetings, Wartwood. You miss me?
Oh, man. You stink. (groans)
Whose fault is that?
Since the tower fell, we've had to live as bandits.
What do you want, Bog?
Nothing much.
Just everything valuable you frogs got.
And if we refuse?
Then we'll have ourselves a little cookout,
burn this whole place to the ground.
(gasps)
So, what'll it be, Mayor?
(sighs)
Look after Toadie for me.
Time for me to do what I do best...
lie to a fairly large group of people.
Look at you, Bog.
I'm surprised you ain't thinking bigger.
What do you mean?
I mean,
how'd you like to be my second-in-command
at the newly rebuilt Toad Town?
What's he talking about? (murmurs)
Mayor Toadstool's leaving us?
Huh. But I heard you liked being Mayor now.
Me, like being Mayor of a disgusting, Podunk, mudhole town like this?
Ha. Not a chance.
Well, we are tired of living in caves and eating scraps.
Then you're gonna love this next bit.
(grunts)
Join me and half of this is yours.
It's beautiful.
Oh, I agree. Why not take a closer look?
(groans) Attack!
Get 'em, boys.
(grunting)
(screams)
Where'd you go?
Whoops. Sorry, Mire.
(screaming)
(grunts)
Go get him, Archie.
(cheers)
(clears throat) I know. It's time to go to Toad Tower.
Just give me a minute to say goodbye.
All this time, I thought you were the right toad for this job.
But it looks like I was wrong.
-Huh? -You're soft, Toadstool. Way too soft.
You love this town, and any moron can see it.
I'm afraid we need someone cutthroat, someone ruthless.
Someone just like him.
- Huh? - (gasps)
Uh, you pointing at the right guy?
You were seconds away from burning this town
if you didn't get what you wanted.
We could use that kind of resolve
that kind of backbone, that kind of ambition.
So, how 'bout it, Bog?
Wanna rule this valley together?
When do we start?
Sorry, Froderick, but a heart is the one thing
the Head of Toad Tower can't have.
See you around, Wartwood.
I'm gonna make Grime seem like a big softy.
(chuckles maniacally)
Well, that went well.
Who am I kidding? This is terrible!
Everyone, about what I said back there...
Ah, shove off, you big galoot.
We knew you were just looking out for the town.
You may be a corrupt, no-good, money-grabbing louse...
But you're our money-grabbing louse.
(sniffs)
I don't know what to say.
(gasps, grunts)
Don't leave me!
I won't, Toadie.
I won't. (sighs)
Who's that snuggly little baby? (sighs)
Who is that? Who is that?
(coos)
Anne: Uh, should we be watching this?
Maddie: Seed of swordspine, one cup of dirt from a widow's grave, add both to bubbling bog water, and finally, one half drop of worm snake venom. Steady... steady...
Rosemary, Lavender and Ginger: Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie!
Maddie: Hi, Rosemary, Ginger, and Lavender. What are you doing here?
Rosemary: Hey, sis! You promise you play with us, remember?
Maddie: I'm in a middle of a spell. We can play tomorrow.
Ginger: That's what you said yesterday.
Maddie: Look, Mrs. Jonkins is counting on me to bring her pet, Fleafy, back to life.
(bird caws)
Maddie: Hey, hey! Get out of here! Necromancy is really advanced magic. It said that only level two witches can pull it off. I've only done level spells up so-
Ginger: Boo! Magic is boring!
Lavender: And creepy. Let's play instead!
Rosemary: Remember when you used to juggle us?
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Juggle us! Juggle us!
Maddie: Fine, give me a few minutes to wrap this up, and we'll play.
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Yay!
Maddie: Almost there... (laughs)
Rosemary: What happened to a few minutes?
Maddie: Aah!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Aah!
Maddie: No! That took all morning!
Maddie: Uh, oh.
Marcy: Crockside conifer. What a find! And they said compiling a plant-cyclopedia would be boring.
Maddie and the Sisters: Aah!
Marcy: That doesn't sound good. (Finds Maddie and her sisters, gets excited) No froggin' way! A curse user?! Here?!
Maddie: What's the matter with you three?!
Rosemary: We were just trying to play with you.
Maddie: Well now I definitely don't have time. Go home and help dad with the bakery or something. I swear, sometimes, I wish you three would grow up.
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Aww.
Maddie: (groans)
Marcy: Okay, Marce. Be cool. Just get out there and introduce yourself with confidence.
Marcy: Hi, there!
Maddie: Aah!
Marcy: My name's Marcy!
Maddie: Oh, oops. You're Anne's friend, right?
Marcy: Oh, my gosh! That was the coolest thing ever! Some kind of low-grade fire curse?
Maddie: (intrigued) I'm impressed you knew that! Do you also have an interest in the dark arts?
Marcy: Are you kidding?! I've read every Cynthia Coven book, five times! I searched all over Newtopia for someone who could teach me, but magic users are so rare these days.
Maddie: (even more impressed) Wow! No one's ever interested in what I do! They usually run away screaming!
Marcy: Baby, I'm running towards you! How do you feel about that?
Maddie: I'm feeling like a beautiful friendship is about to start. Wanna be my apprentice and help me bring a dead flea back to life?
Marcy: (puts her bangs over her right eye) Do I ever!
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs)
Maddie: If we're gonna bring this flea back to life, we need a few more ingredients. First up, bile of a vomit bird.
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs)
Maddie: Then, some big ol' ticks.
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs and screams)
Maddie: A really rotted corpse.
Maddie: No. No. Hey, perfect!
Hop Pop: Did you girls mistake me for a corpse?!
Marcy: Of "corpse" not, Hop Pop.
Maddie: Fresh soil from a graveyard.
Maddie: Assorted limbs.
Maddie: And lastly, a high-five from your new best bud.
Maddie: Well, this is me. (groans). I hope my sisters are asleep. I do not want to deal with them right now.
Marcy: What's wrong with your little sisters?
Maddie: It's a long story. I used to play with them all the time. Especially, juggling; that was their favorite. Then, I got my own interests. Magic became my passion, my calling. I didn't have time to waste on kids stuff anymore. And ever since then, they've been so annoying.
Marcy: As someone who goes hard into her hobbies, I relate. But, don't you think you should still make time for them occasionally?
Maddie: Nonsense. Being a witch is a big responsibility, Marcy. I've got more important things to do now than babysit.
Marcy: Well, you are the master. See you at the sacrificial grove tomorrow for an unholy ritual!
Maddie and Marcy: (the do their own unique handshake) Creepy spiders!
Marcy: (squeals) Can't wait!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (groans)
Rosemary: I can't believe it! Maddie replaced us?
Ginger: Why did she want to hang out with that stupid old lady?
Lavender: I wish we were older. And then, Maddie would want to play with us like she used to.
Rosemary: That's it! That's it! That's it! We just have to use one of Maddie's witchy spells to grow up!
Lavender: Grow up?
Ginger: And then we'll be older and Maddie will want to play with us again!
Rosemary and Lavender: Yeah!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (cackles)
Mr. Flour: Night girls!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (innocent eyes) Good night, daddy.
(The next day, Mr. Flour is checking on his bread as Maddie comes downstairs.)
Mr. Flour: (not turning around) Morning, daughter.
Maddie: Dad, have you seen my spell book? I need to perform a level 2 resurrection with my apprentice.
Mr. Flour: Well, I think I saw your sisters with it.
Maddie: Aah! I'm gonna kill them! (runs back upstairs)
Mr. Flour: Well, make sure you resurrect them when you're done.
Maddie: What have I told you about playing with my stuff?!
Lavender: We're not playing, we're making a witchy spell.
Maddie: (gasps) Oh, what did you do to my book?! It's ruined! This is why I don't spend time with you anymore because you're annoying, little babies!
Rosemary: Won't be babies for much longer.
Marcy: Check it out! My first successful curse! Some kind of horrible abomination!
Flower: (yodels)
Marcy: (covers the flower's mouth) Okay, that's enough. You okay?
Maddie: I'm so done with my sisters. Look what they did to my spell book!
Marcy: Yeesh. They didn't even color in the lines.
Flower: Tsk tsk tsk tsk.
Maddie: Whatever. They won't stop me from reaching level two. Let's get to resurrecting.
Marcy: (gasps) It's alive. It's alive! Or there's a slight breeze.
Maddie and Marcy: (gasps)
Maddie: We did it! We did it! I'm finally a level 2 witch! (notices a growing shadow and looks up) Huh?
Ginger: Maddie!
Maddie and Marcy: (screams)
Maddie: Fleafy!
Marcy: Holy cow!
Ginger: Found you!
Maddie: Wait, Ginger?!
Ginger: You wanted us grown up.
Rosemary: So, here we are!
Maddie: Oh, no they didn't!
Marcy: Didn't what?
Lavender: Come on Maddie, play with us!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Hide and seek!
Maddie and Marcy: (screams)
It's so fortunate that the music box
fell into such average hands.
How exactly did it come into you possession?
Uh... Uh-uh.
You know? I don't remember how we got it.
(rumbling)
Huh... What was that?
Nothing much. Just an avalanche.
(all) What? Everybody run!
Shush, you loud little frog baby!
(rumbling)
Whew. Looks like it's heading away from us.
(Anne) Wait a second. Look!
What about that little hut? It looks like someone inside.
We have to save them!
How? By running towards an avalanche?
They are lost, child. I say we press on.
(groans)
Nuts to that!
(all) Anne!
(grunts) Hey! You guys gotta get outta-- Huh?
How is eveyone out to lunch right now?
-(rumbling) -(grunting)
Anne! We gotcha!
(grunting)
You okay? (pants) I'm fine. I'm fine.
Let's just hurry and get to the temple.
(Valeriana) Oh, that won't be happening.
I've learned all I need to know about you lot.
Disobedient, foolish, impulsive.
None of these qualities are worthy of the sacred stones.
You don't deserve my help.
Good luck finding that temple on your own.
You are full of such frog split!
(all gasp)
Oh, come on. You barely even gave us a chance!
Not only that, now you're gonna strand us out gere?
Well, we may be unworthy, but you and your order are even worse!
You're nothing but a cruel, judgmental, snob!
(echoes)
Brat!
You dare insult the order I have dedicated my entire life to?
Yeah? What're you gonna do about it?
Huh?
Did you guys see that?
Huh? Whoa!
Where are we?
What did you do?
Just show me and my friends where the temple is already.
Never. You are not worthy.
In fact, none are worthy!
And now that I finally have you alone,
I can return the box to its rightful guardian...
me!
Huh? (squawks)
Hey, wait! No!
No! I need that to get home!
(Valeriana) Aha! See?
Still only thinking of yourself!}} !Anne |You're wrong! I'm not... that selfish! |-
!Valeriana |Oh no? Didn't you lie to the Plantars to get out of a day of work? |-
!Anne |(panting) How-- How do you know that? Whoa! |-
!Valeriana |Didn't you drive the family snail even though you were told not to? |-
!Anne |(grunts) Okay. This is getting weird. What else do you know? |-
!Valeriana |I know that you snore. |-
!Anne |Could've kept that one to yourself. Whoa! |-
!Valeriana |Didn't you still Hopediah's wallet for a girls' day on the town? |-
|colspan=2 align=center|Okay. That is definitely not how that happened.
But you did steal the music box. Did you not?
I... I... I did steal it.
So it is. You are a liar and a thief!
And now, the box will be mine!
(laughs)
(screams, grunts)
(laughing)
Why are you laughing?
You can't get back down the mountain without me.
Ha! You have to save me.
Don't I just wave the stick up and down to get back?
You weren't supposed to figure that out! (screams)
(grunts)
(grunts, sighs)
(sighs) You risked your life to save me?
But why?
You were right. I did lie and steal.
If that makes me unworthy, fine.
Those bad choices were mine and I'll own them.
But making them taught me that it's always better to do the right thing.
So that's what I did, regardless of how much I didn't want to.
We have been waiting for someone like you for such a long time.
Um... excuse me?
Whoa, mama. You clean up nice.
You have sacrificed your warmth for your friends,
your safety for a stranger in need.
You even risked your life for an enemy.
But empathy alone isn't enough, for what is heart without responsibility?
In the name of the temple,
I declare you worthy.
Wait! No way! So the cardinal, the avalanche--
-All this was-- -A trial.
You see, we've been making our way through the "temple" this whole time.
And I have been testing you.
(squawks) Testing you!
(clears throat) So, what is it you want?
Oh, right. To charge the stone and return home!
So be it!
(grunts)
(beeping)
It's a lot slower than last time.
Sorry. This thing's pretty old.
Ah! No, no, no. I get it. No problem.
Do you want, uh, something to read or...
Seriously, it's fine. (Plantars screaming)
Oh, no! They're in trouble. What if it's another avalanche?
Uh, that looks charged enough. Let's go!
Send me back! Send me back! Send me back! Send me back!
(wind howling)
Send me back! Oh!
(screaming) Hang on, guys!
I got you! Huh?
Anne!
Marcy is showing us ridiculously cute animal videos on her phone.
We looked for you, but now we're taking a break.
Anne, you're all right.
And that's not all, fam.
Wha-pow!
(all) Ooh! Whoo!
But how? I'll explain later.
But for now, can we please get out of this cold?
(laughs) Yeah!
Way to go, Anne! Way to go!
(Polly) Anne!
Maybe Frobo can make us hot chocolate when we get back.
-Oooh! -(Polly) Yay!
-(Sprig) Yes! -(Anne) That sounds great. |-
}}
Captain Bufo: So, the disgraced Captain Grime called this council meeting? Does anyone have any idea why?
Captain Beatrix: Maybe he wants to be surrounded by friends when he gets arrested. What do you think, Aldo?
(popping)
Bufo: Uh, is he asleep or dead?
Beatrix: Definitely smells dead.
(all laughing)
Braddock: Not exactly a welcoming crowd.
Percy: Especially that Captain Beatrix! What's her problem?
Grime: Her problem is that she's my sister. And I may have teased her quite a bit when we were tadpoles.
What?
Get out!
Braddock: That's it! Stick a fork in us. We're done.
Sasha: Enough loser talk. We can do this. Just remember what we practiced and keep your eye on the prize.
Percy: Ooh! That reminds me... I have one last touch for our outfits. Now we really are a team.
Grime: One eye. I see what you did there.
Sasha: Nice one, Perce! Now, come on everyone. Let's get out there and impress some toads... or we die!
(all) Whoo!
Dang it, Beatrix. What's your brother waiting for?
(thud)
(drumroll)
(pop music playing)
(all gasp)
(groans, grunts)
(grunts)
Grime: (clears throat) My fellow toads. For years, we have kept the kingdom's servants in line. But are we not just servants ourselves? I propose a future where toads overthrow King Andrias, and take our rightful place as rulers of all Amphibia!
Sasha: Psst. Drop the mic.
Grime: Oh! Uh, right!
(feedback)
(crickets chirping)
You all took a huge risk coming here to gain support for your rebellion.
And it paid off. We frogging loved it!
(cheering)
Ow! Ow!
Beatrix: Nicely done, Grimothy.
Sasha: No way! Is your real name...
Grime: You're not talking about this!
Bufo: So tell us, tell us, who's leading this revolution?
Grime: I was thinking... us?
(Bufo and Beatrix whisper to each other.)
Bufo: Yeah, I don't think so. We love your vision, but no toad is going to follow the command of a fugitive and his hummus.
Sasha: Humans. We're called humans.
Beatrix: Bufo's right. Just because King Andrias is working with a couple of hummuses doesn't mean us toads will go for it.
Sasha: Wait, other humans? They must be talking about Anne and Marcy. I don't believe it. They're working together? Without me?
Grime: And apparently aiding the crown.
Bufo: Speaking of which, this whole thing is beginning to sound too risky. Guards! Arrest them!
(grunting)
(Sasha screams in anger and charges at the toads.)
Grime: Sasha, no!
(screaming)
(grunting)
(grunts)
Sasha: Listen here, you buffoon! What's it gonna take to prove than you should follow us?
(growling)
Aldo: Barrel's Warhammer.
Bufo: Barrel's Hammer? You've finally gone senile, Aldo.
Beatrix: Yeah, that's a suicide mission.
Aldo: It is said that the one who wields this hammer is the true leader of all toads. It is the one thing, the only thing, that will prove we should follow you.
Sasha: Great! Done! You'll have it in your Crypt-keeper hands by morning.
Bufo, Beatrix: (both gasp, laugh)
Bufo: No toad has ever gone after the hammer and made it back alive. This I've gotta see.
Sasha: So, what's this hammer, and why are y'all so scared of it?
A little late to be asking, don't you think?
It's the weapon of the legendary toad warrior, Barrel the Brave!
Barrel gave his life defending a helpless village from a terrifying beast!
Legend has it that this same beast guards his hammer to this very day.
Enough whimpering! We don't even know if this tadpole tale is real.
Listen, if things get too wild out here, just give me a signal and I'll call the whole thing off.
A signal? What kind of signal?
Hmm. How about this? Do your best kawaii pose. It's something we do for photos in my world. Like this.
- What's a photo?
- Just try it.
(laughs)
No giggling!
We're here.
(screeching)
Hey, Sash.
Thanks for that.
I feel better already.
Sasha: Hey, my pleasure. And don't forget, just strike a pose and we'll leave.
According to the map Aldo gave us,
we should be close to where the Hammer was last seen.
This is insane.
Even if it exists, we'll never find it.
Found it!
I don't believe it. It's real. (laughs)
Our ticket to revolution!
And no beast in sight!
Could life actually be this easy for a change?
Quick, Grime-sy! Yank that thing out already.
(straining, sighs)
(straining) A little help here.
Okay, gang. On three.
One, two, three.
(all straining)
The (stammers) beast!
Look alive! Who knows where it'll come from...
(all screaming)
(gasps)
(grunting)
(roaring)
(laughs) What a great way to go!
(roaring continues)
Sorry, guys, but we're way too close to bail.
I am not going back empty-handed.
But... You said...
Steer us closer. We need to get it to attack us.
(both) What? Trust me!
(Grime strains)
(grunting)
(clinking)
(growls)
Sasha: All right, now we've got its attention. Get ready. Three, two, one, now!
(both scream, grunt)
Percy, Braddock: (both) Whoa!
(grunting)
(grunts, strains)
(screams)
Percy: Ah, man. That was my mom's boat.
(grunts, strains)
(all straining)
(groans)
Sasha: This thing's never coming loose!
(Sasha lets go of the hammer and runs to the narwhal worm's horn. She throws her cape aside and pulls out a lasso. She swings the lasso around and throws it up at the horn.)
(grunting)
(growls)
(all screaming)
Percy, Braddock: (both screaming, grunting)
(screaming)
Grime: What do you think you're doing?!
Sasha: What's it look like?! I'm getting the Warhammer back to the tower!
Grime: You're insane and I love it!
Percy, Braddock: (both screaming)
Toad Scientist: Last Toad Summit was all about improvements to Toad armor durability. This year, the R & D team gives you armor customization.
(all cheer)
Bufo: Ooh, that ducky looks nice.
Lady Toad Soldier: Whoo, yeah.
(monster growls)
Lady Toad Soldier: Hey Greg, what do you think that is?
(Greg, the toad wearing a "Toadz Rule!!" shirt, turns around with a pair of binoculars.)
Greg: Hmm, that's clearly a narwhal-worm being ridden by a hummus, heading straight for us.
(Greg and the lady toad exchange glances, then both scream.)
(growls)
Percy: Sasha... please... stop this!
Sasha: But we're almost there!
Grime: (gasps) The tower! It's coming up too fast. We're going to crash into it. Go left! Go left!
Sasha: (gasps, grunts)
(The Narwhal worm growls, whistle blows)
Sasha: (strains) I can't! I've lost control of it!
(both grunting)
Grime: There must be another way to stop it.
Sasha: The Warhammer. It's the only weapon big enough to dent this thing's armor.
(both straining)
Grime: (sighs) It's no use. Sasha, we've got to get out of here or we'll all die.
Sasha: No! I can do this! I am not gonna fail! Not while Anne and Marcy are getting by without me!
(groans)
(straining)
Sasha: Ha! (groans) Whoa!
(Grime grunts)
(both screaming)
(grunts)
(both screaming)
(Grime grunts)
(growls)
(Greg and the lady toad scream at the approaching worm.)
(all gasp)
Aldo, Bufo, Beatrix: Huh?
Sasha: One Warhammer as promised.
(all exclaim)
(all cheer)
Aldo: We hereby grant you the support of all three towers for your rebellion.
Sasha: Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Grime: Well, Lieutenant, I had my doubts, but we did it.
Sasha: Of course, we did. After all, we're the best team in this or any other world. Right, Braddock? Percy?
Percy, Braddock: (both scream)
Sasha: Whoa, you guys okay?
Percy: "Okay"? Sasha, we almost died back there.
Braddock: We trusted you, and you didn't care one bit about what happened to us as long as you got what you wanted.
Sasha: That's not true. Besides, we did it.
Percy: No, Sasha, you did it. And I think me and Braddock are done with this. With all of it.
Sasha: What? Where are you going? Guys, come back. You're not actually gonna throw this all away, are you? We are so close. I can feel it.
Percy: Goodbye, Sash. We hope you pull it off. We really do.
Grime: That's enough, Lieutenant.
Sasha: Get out of my way, Grime.
Grime: Just let them go, Sasha. We all have our limits. It looks like they finally hit theirs.
Sasha: But-
Grime: I know it hurts. But remember, every dream has its price, and not everyone's willing to pay it. Now come on, soldier. We've got a world to conquer.
Sasha: Goodbye, Percy. Goodbye, Braddock.
(snoring)
Polly: Good work, everyone! Wish I could help, but... no legs, you know?
Anbe: Mm-hmm.
Hop Pop: We depart for the final temple tomorrow, Bessie, ol' gal, and I have a big job for ya. Speak of the frog devil. Polly, leave Micro-Angelo here with us and get back to packin'.
Polly: Want me to grab a weapon or two from the hidden armory under the house?
Hop Pop: Go grab a weapon or three, dear. These temples have been pretty nasty, and I wanna be ready for anything.
Polly: That's what I'm talkin' about!
Hop Pop: Now then, Bessie, you remember Micro-Angelo? The cute little snail we bought in Newtopia? Well, I'm sure you've noticed that he is young and cute and needs to be protected at all costs.
Micro-Angelo: Meep.
By contrast, you are an older snail. Much older. I mean, you've seen your share of winters, that's for sure. The point is, while we're busy packing today, I'm gonna need you to take this little cutie under your shell, all right? He's your responsibility. Can I trust you with this very important job? That's my good girl. Don't let me down. 'Kay. Thanks. Bye.
Meep.
Meep.
Meep!
Ahh.
Can't have too many maps. Or can you?
Definitely gonna need these bad boys. And now to get more deadly weapons. Ha-ha!
Marcy: (clears her throat) So, Anne, I think we can both agree everything's riding on this last temple.
Anne: Yep.
Marcy: And can we also agree that you need some new gear already?
(She motions to Anne's sock, which is more worn out up close.)
Anne: Fair.
Marcy: Ah, good. Because I already fly-mailed Newtopia's best armorer, and he's on his way right now to give you a whole new look!
Anne: Hold up. Did she just say "new look"?
Sprig: Yep. What's the problem?
Anne: Oh, no. Not again. I cannot tell you how many times Sasha and Marcy have tried to give me a makeover!
(Three flashbacks on Earth show Anne sporting bad haircuts. The last one shows her screaming because she's bald.)
Marcy: (holding a razor) Too short?
(Back to the present.)
Anne: This is not gonna go well.
Meep, meep.
Meep.
Meep, meep.
My name is Bernardo.
Who is in need of my services?
Never mind. It is clearly you.
Is it really that bad?
It's worse.
I don't know, Mar-Mar.
These old duds have been good to me, you know?
Anne, we're probably going home soon.
Don't you want to live the fantasy a little? Try a new identity?
Role-play? Enough chitty-chatty.
Anne, who do you want to be?
Uh...
A melee-focused warrior?
Maybe a staff-wielding mage.
Well, I'm excited to see what you pick. Have fun, you two.
I'm gonna go mix a bunch of potions for tomorrow.
But... In Newtopia this season, it is all about barbarian.
Furs. Metal studs. Mallets. Everyone looks good in barbarian.
Trust me.
Barbarian sounds pretty cool.
Why don't you just wear a few and see how you feel? It won't hurt to try.
First up, this lovely little number covered with painful poison barbs.
Never mind. That looks like it'll hurt. Sprig!
Meep! Meep!
My potion!
Meep, meep.
Hmm. Aah!
Ow. Holy hornets! My maps!
Bessie, what's gotten into you?
You're supposed to be looking after Micro-Angelo,
not causing a frog-dang ruckus!
What the heck happened?
I thought you were my good girl.
This was obviously just too much responsibility for ya.
Come on, Bessie.
Oh?
Sorry, old girl.
Today's preparations are just too important.
Meep? Meep, meep.
Meep?
Uh, guys?
Not really sure this is my style.
I think you look neat. Loving that loincloth.
Hmm, it is a bit loud. Let's try a few options.
- Eggwellems! - Aah!
Perhaps a sorceress supreme?
Eh, too magical.
An elite commando?
Too formal.
Crane style! Mantis style!
Moth style. No more bugs!
Your friend is, um, how to say?
Hard to please. Tell me about it.
Guys, this stuff is cool and all, but it's too much.
I mean, who even needs these giant metal hands?
Technically speaking, those are siege gauntlets with built-in fire launchers.
Is that a tiny trebuchet?
I'm gonna touch it. No, Sprig, no!
Oops. Sprig!
Meep! Meep!
Aah!
What in the world?
Oh! What's happening?
Wow.
Somebody please narrate what's happening.
What?
Oh, my frog, Bessie!
Not only did you save Micro-Angelo,
you saved us from being nearly obliterated.
- Who put these boom shrooms here? - Uh, guilty.
Help. Please.
Are you okay? Anne!
Anne: This feels... perfect! (raises her fists)
Marcy: (holding Anne's cheeks) Are you ok? Did you hit your head? Are you crazy now?
Anne: Listen, I think the reason I don't want a new look because I'm finally happy with who I see in the mirror right now. So no matter what I put on, I just wanna see the same person smiling back. So what do you guys think?
Bernardo: Minimalist. Bernardo like.
Marcy: You're right. It is perfect.
Sprig: Whoo!
Marcy: But a summer cut might be cute. (She moves her fingers like scissors. Anne gets annoyed and slaps her hand away.)
Hop Pop: Looks like I owe you an apology. I knew you were my good girl. And you know? Maybe it was all too much to put on your shoulders. Tell you what. After today, you'll never have to look after Micro-Angelo again. How's that... sound?
Okay. Whatever you guys want.
I mean, you'd know better.
(Open on Earth, where a young Anne is busy swinging.)
Young Anne: Look, Marmar! I'm an eagle!
Young Marcy: Cool! Well, I'm a twin engine cemax amphibious aircraft!
Young Anne and Marcy: (laugh and scream)
Mean Girl #1: Oh, how cute. Now beat it. These swings are ours.
Young Anne and Marcy: (start crying)
Young Sasha: Not so fast, evildoers! Leave those kids alone!
Young Anne and Marcy: Whoa!
Young Sasha: (screams and trips) I'm not done yet. I'll never give up! No matter what!
Young Sasha: (screams and trips)
Mean Girl #2: This is getting weird.
Mean Girl #1: Yeah, we're out of here. Enjoy your swings, babies.
Young Sasha: (laughs) Swings are all yours!
Young Anne: Hey, you wanna swing with us?
Young Sasha: I-I'd like that.
Young Anne: I'm Anne, by the way. This is Marcy.
Young Marcy: Hiya!
Young Sasha: I'm Sasha. Sasha Waybright!
(Flash forward to the present where everyone, joined by Frobo, has arrived at a volcano.)
Anne: And, wha-bam!
The Plantars and Marcy: Whoa!
Anne: The entrance to the third temple.
Sprig: What's it say, Marcy? What's it say?!
Marcy: Well, this can't be right. Lift to enter, "brah?"
The Plantars, Anne, and Marcy: Wow!
Hop Pop: Way to go, Frobo!
Anne: Alright, let's go crush this temple!
The Plantars and Marcy: Yeah!
Hop Pop: Look after Joe Sparrow, Frobo. We'll be back soon.
Anne: Whoo! It's hot in here!
Marcy: All right, gang! There should be three challenges just like the two other temp-les?
The Plantars: (groan and cough)
Anne: Whoa. Are you guys okay?
Hop Pop: Just a little dehydrated from the heat. We'll be alright.
Marcy: Whoa, there boss. Think you're strong to get across?
Anne: I have a distinct feeling that this temple is about strength.
Sprig: Wonder what those are for.
(monster roars)
Anne: Sprig!
Anne: Man, this thing weighs a ton!
Anne, Plantars, and Marcy: (yells)
Marcy: All right, guys. It's hammer time!
Polly: Yeah, this ain't happening.
Anne: I'll defend you guys. Don't sweat it.
Marcy and the Plantars: (scream)
Anne: Guys, no!
Marcy and the Plantars: (screams)
The Plantars: (gasps)
Anne: It can't be.
Marcy: Sash! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe-
Sasha: There's no time! Follow me!
Anne: Sasha.
Sasha: Hey, girlfriend! Good to see you!
Anne: You too?
Marcy: Aah! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha!
Sasha: (laughs) Hey, Marmar! Whoa! Check out your new threads!
Marcy: Speak for yourself, look at that armor! How did you find us?!
Sasha: Simple. We heard you two were traveling together and tracked you both here.
Anne: Did you say we?
Grime: (cackles) Even in this state, those things were no match for me.
Anne and the Plantars: (grumbles)
Sasha: (laughs) Cancel the red alert. Seriously, we're not here to fight.
Sprig: Oh, no?
Sasha: Nope. The whole reason we were stalking you was... so I could tell Anne that everything that happened at Toad Tower was my fault.
Anne: Really?
Sasha: Yup. It was wrong of me to put your frog friends in danger. And doubly wrong of me to push you around.
Anne: Oh. Huh. Wasn't expecting that.
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Forgive me for being skeptical, but why the change of heart?
Grime: After Toad Tower, Sasha and I lost everything.
Sasha: We had to go into hiding and I had a lot of time to think about things. But (chuckles) what are you guys doing in a honkin' volcano?
Marcy: Oh, Sasha. It's crazy! The king of Amphibia told us the music box can transport us back home! But the stones need to be charged at three temples first! This is the third temple!
Sasha: No way! You mean we can almost go home?
Anne: Yup!
Marcy: Each temple has a theme. And this one appears to be strength.
Sasha: Then it's a good thing I showed up.
Sprig: What's that supposed to mean?
Sasha: It means you three are going to slow us down. Go wait outside until we're done.
Anne: Hey! You can't tell them what to do!
Sasha: Okay, fine. It was just a suggestion. Now, come on. Let's move.
Anne: Do you really think she's changed?
Hop Pop: Time will tell, Anne. Time will tell. Say, you got any of that lippy balm? Lips are feeling pretty dry.
Anne: You guys want cantaloupe flavor or bubblegum?
Plantars: Cantaloupe! Cantaloupe!
Hop Pop: Oh, sweet relief!
Anne: You can keep that.
Marcy: Sup, bro'seph. Do you even lift?
Anne: It's not even trying anymore.
Sasha: Ha! This is all me!
Anne: Wait, Sash? Marcy and I have done these temples, and there's always some kind of catch. Let's just search the room before we try that thing.
Sasha: Eh, that'll take too long. Besides, this temple's been pretty direct so far.
Anne: No. Wait, Sasha. I really think we should-
Sasha: (groans)
Anne: Huh.
Sasha: This thing's gonna be over before it starts. Let's get going, nerds.
Grime: By nerds, she means you guys.
Marcy: All right, this should be the final room.
Marcy: You've definitely got skill, no doubt. But it's time you learn what strength is all about.
Sasha: Stay back, everyone. I got this.
Grime: Great grasshopper guts! It's like an elephant tick is standing on my back!
Marcy: That thing has somehow increased the room's gravitational force.
Sprig: I-I can't get up.
Anne: Just sit tight. Us humans will handle this.
Polly: You go, girls.
Marcy: Thanks, Sasha.
Sasha: No problem.
Marcy: The gravity's too much. I can't move.
Sasha: Don't worry. Leave this to us.
Anne: Who would've thought us working together after everything has happened?
Sasha: Yeah, unbelievable. Especially since you still don't trust me. Even after I apologized.
Anne: What?
Anne: What do you mean? I trust you.
Sasha: Oh, please. I've been watching you the whole time. You don't trust me at all.
Anne: Well can you blame me? Oh! Why would I trust you? It wasn't just Toad Tower, Sasha. You've been pushing me around my whole life.
Sasha: I know.
Anne: It feels like my lungs are going to explode.
Sasha: It's over. We can't do this.
Anne: You're right. We can't. But you can. I believe in you.
Sasha: What? How can you believe in me after I was such a jerk to you?
Anne: Because you weren't just a jerk, you also inspired us. You're fierce, you're brave, and most of all, you never give up.
Sasha: You're right! (groans) I'll never give up. Not today, not ever!
Anne, Marcy, Grime and the Plantars: (gasps)
Sprig: How heavy was that armor?
Sasha: (groans) Get croaked!
Marcy: The gravity's back to normal! You did it, Sash!
Anne: Here, go ahead.
Marcy: Congrats, brah. You finally know what it takes to go the distance. For what is true strength without persistence.
Anne: Want to do the honors? I guess that's that. Should we open it?
Marcy: No! No! No! If we turn that thing on, who knows what we'll end up? We should bring it to King Andrias so he can tell us how to use it correctly to get home.
Sasha: Of course! Trust Marcy to already have a plan!
Marcy: Look at this! The gang finally back together again! Now, come on. Let's get back to Wartwood and get these frogs some water.
Polly: Give me that.
Sprig: Finally!
Polly: Take me to my bucket.
Sasha: Thanks for all of that stuff back there. Believing in me and junk.
Anne: Oh, hey. No biggie. I'm sorry for not trusting you earlier. Sasha, do you think maybe we could start over? Do things right this time?
Sasha: I- I'd like that.
Anne: (clears throat) Well, I'm gonna walk away before things get more awkward.
Sasha: (laughs) Not possible.
Grime: You haven't forgotten the plan, have you? We only need these jokers to get safely into Newtopia.
Sasha: Of course, I haven't forgotten. And I'm pretty sure they bought my act back there. Hook, line, and sinker.
Grime: Good. Because the things we've set into motion cannot be stopped.
(Upbeat music plays as we get a view of the citizens of Wartwood are gathered in front of a stage)
Marcy: Hey Sash.
Sasha: Hey.
Mayor Toadstool: Simmer down, everyone. Simmer down. Ahem. Now I know we've all been a little on edge since Sasha and Captain Grime came to Wartwood.
Sasha: What? Why? 'Cause we invaded the town?
Grime: Yeah, it was just one time
Mayor Toadstool: Point is, we could all use some levity. So let's consult the Wheel of Fun.
(All cheer)
Random Citizen: Oh, my frog. It's the wheel of fun.
(Toadstool spins the Wheel of Fun)
Soggy Joe: Come on, Massage Train.
(Wheel of Fun lands on Battle of the Bands)
Soggy Joe: Aw.
Mayor Toadstool: All right, everyone. Get your teams together and start rehearsing. Wartwood is having a Battle of the Bands.
Anne: You guys think Wartwood is ready for a "Sasha and the Sharps" reunion?
Sprig: The what and the who?
Marcy: It was a garage band the three of us had back home.
Sasha: We used to slay at talent shows.
(The screen zooms in on Sasha as fire builds up in the background.)
Hop Pop: Why is everything you say so aggro?
Wally: Hopidiah, Sprig, wanna join me and Loggle's jug band?
Hop Pop: You Kidding?
Sprig: Do we ever!
Anne: Come on, ladies. We can practice in my room.
Sasha: Hey Grime-sy. I'm gonna go rehearse with the girls. You all right going solo?
(The screen zooms in on Grime as the background goes black.)
Grime: Oh yes. All shall tremble at my performance.
(Grime then skips away happy, and giggling.)
Toadie: All right sir, I'm ready for rehearsal.
Mayor Toadstool: Are you kidding me, Toadie? I just bought myself a 12-hour nap. Why don't you take a little time for yourself?
Toadie: T-t-time for myself?
(Cut to the Planters house, Anne, Marcy, and Sasha are practicing in Anne's room.)
Anne: What you got there, Sash?
Sasha: A dope axe-beetle from Toad Tower. Check this out.
(Sasha pulls out a pink gem and inserts it into a slot in the axe-beetle. She strums the axe-beetle sending out a wave of pink energy. Marcy starts playing on the drums, and Anne starts playing her guitar. They all start playing "rock music" together. Marcy looses her grip on her sticks they fly across the room knocking Sasha to the ground. All of them start laughing.)
Anne: Sasha and the Sharps are back, baby!
Marcy: So, what song should we play at the battle?
Sasha: We should definitely play my song "Heart Stomper." It was always a hit back home.
Marcy: Oh! I'm into that. Anne? Anne?
Anne: Ahem. Actually I wrote a song about Amphibia and I was hoping we could play it.
Marcy: You didn't tell me you were writing a song. Let's do it. I mean, if that's okay with you, Sasha?
Sasha: (With an annoyed expression on her face) For sure. Teach it to us, Anne.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
All Girls Singing: Riding snails, But it's no big deal. (Marcy) Eating flies. (All Girls) But it's no big deal. (Anne) Finally me, and it's no big deal.
Anne: And here's where Sasha plays a killer guitar solo. We sing the refrain one more time, and then we're done.
Marcy: Nice work, Anna-Banana. Fun to play too.
Anne: Sasha, what do you think?
Sasha: It's good. I just have a few tiny notes that I think could make it even better.
Anne: Oh, okay.
Sasha: Great, these lyrics are all over the place totally. They'll have to change. Uh, are these bug suits? Oh, no, no, no. Mar-mar, the drumming is a little to dense. Let's strip some of these down. And you, we definitely need more lights. (Dumps mushrooms on Polly until she's buried) Frobo, too much fog, yet not enough fog. You feel me? Boom! Fixed it.
Marcy: It does seem simpler.
Anne: Yeah these are solid ideas. But, it's just not my song anymore. The lyrics are different, the melody is different. It's just different.
Sasha: That's called collaboration, Anne.
Anne: This isn't collaboration, it's a hostile takeover. Why do things always have to be your way?
Sasha: (sighs) So now, once again, I'm forcing you to do things my way. You know what, maybe I should just leave and join a different band.
Marcy: What?
Anne: No, Sasha! it'll be more fun if you're here with us.
Sasha: Listen if I leave, you guys can have all the fun you want. I can have all the control I want. And we can all get what we want.
Anne: Well, I guess that makes sense.
Sasha: Don't worry. I'll still be rooting for you guys. This is just how I go sometimes. I'll see you tonight.
Anne: So much for Sasha and the Sharps. Who's gonna do the guitar solo now?
Marcy: I'm sure we'll be fine. Probably.
(Both girls sigh heavily.)
Polly: You guys done moping? 'Cause Frobes and I charge by the hour.
(Sasha walks over to Felicia's Tea Shop. She knocks on the guest room door where Grime is practicing his act.)
Grime: Who is it? What do you want?
Sasha: Grime-sy! How would you like to be in a band with me?
Grime: Yeah, no. I'm a solo act.
Sasha: What the heck's wrong with you? You know this isn't a real battle, right?
Grime: Be that as it may, I still intend to win. Look behind you.
(Sasha looks over her shoulder.)
Sasha: Huh?
(Grime shoves her away from the door.)
Grime: Ha-ha!
(Sasha leaves the tea shop and sits down near the town statue.)
Sasha: Looks like I'm a solo act, unless I can find someone who wants to do everything I say.
(On the other side of the statue, Toadie sighs.)
Toadie: Mayor's napping. Everyone is already in a band. Who am I supposed to play music with that will also boss me around?
(Toadie plays a sad note. Sasha approaches him.)
Sasha: You, tiny sad frog. You're coming with me.
(In the forest, Sasha and Toadie are playing "Heart Stomper.")
Sasha Singing: I'm a heart stomper! Stompin' on hearts! If you wanna get away, you're gonna need a head start!
Sasha: Take it, Toadie!
(Toadie starts playing his drum.)
Sasha: Yes! Play that drum! Blow the horn!
(Toadie starts to play his horn.)
Sasha: Now, strike the final pose!
(Sasha and Toadie pose, and the song ends. Toadie falls to the ground, panting.)
Sasha: Not bad. What if the bridge was an F-sharp instead of C-sharp?
Toadie: Love it!
Sasha: Oh, and maybe at the end, we could do the splits.
Toadie: No problem!
Sasha: (in a sarcastic tone) And how about we shoot you out of a cannon?
Toadie: Totally here for it.
Sasha: Come on, don't just agree with everything I say. What's your actual opinion?
Toadie: (sits up) Oh, I stopped having opinions years ago. I'm just 100% here to support you.
Sasha: What? How do you even live like that? I have opinions about everything. And if I'm not in control at all times, I'll go crazy. It's actually kind of exhausting.
Toadie: Well, maybe you should try letting go a little. Let someone else take the reins. Pass the baton. Hand over the keys-
Sasha: Thanks, I get it.
Toadie: My point is, most people don't realize just how fun it can be to support someone you really care about.
Sasha: Huh. Well, thanks for that perspective, you weird, little butler frog. Now, come on. We've got a lot of practicing to do if we're gonna win. A one, and a two, and a 20 times through!
Toadie: This is gonna hurt!
(Toadie and Sasha continue to play "rock music." The scene cuts to Wartwood town square, where a stage is set up.)
Mayor Toadstool: Welcome, everyone, to the Battle of the Bands. Goose-lily and I will be your judges for this evening. So, what do you say we get things started?
Duckweed: My name is Duckweed.
Mayor Toadstool: Don't sass me Goose-lily. Hit the lights!
Polly: You got it!
(Chuck walks onstage with two huge tulips.)
Chuck: Ahem.
(The tulips start to melodically moan.)
Chuck: I grow singin' tulips.
Mayor Toadstool: Oh, this is gonna be a long night.
(Toadstool holds up a sign that rates Chuck's act 4. Duckweed rates it a 5. Cut to the next act where Mrs. Croaker is warbling like a theremin. Toadstool rates Mrs. Croaker's act a 2, a confused expression on his face. Duckweed clearly loves it, and rates her act a 10. The scene cuts to the next act, where Loggle, Hop Pop, Wally, and Sprig are all playing country music. During their act, Loggle falls off of his rocking chair.)
Loggle: Whoa, Whoa!
(Toadstool rates their act at a 6. Duckweed gives it a 5.5. Hop Pop, Sprig, Wally, and Loggle leave the stage.)
Hop Pop: That's good enough for me!
Sprig: Mediocrity is comforting.
(Anne and Marcy approach Sasha.)
Anne: Hey, Sasha!
Sasha: Oh, hey guys, those costumes are... something else.
Anne: I'm a Drag-Anne-Fly!
Marcy: And I'm the personification of metamorphosis!
Sasha: Cool. Well, have fun out there.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
Marcy: Yeah, you too.
Toadie: Hey, should we be worried about them?
Sasha: Nah, I've seen their performance, and it's all right. But nowhere near as good as it could've been with me in control. I just wanted all of us to succeed. I was just being a good friend. Why couldn't they see that?
Toadie: I know the feeling. But no matter how badly you want someone to succeed, you can't force it. Because sometimes being a good friend just means being there for them when they need it the most.
Mayor Toadstool: Ladies and gentlefrogs, I give you, The Sharps!
(Crowd cheers. Anne starts playing the guitar. Marcy starts playing the drums.)
Anne, Marcy Singing: (Anne) Took a leap through a box, super weird, to a swamp where frogs talk (Marcy) Oh,oh (Anne) Now I'm stuck, got no plans, just my luck, I'll do the best that I can (Marcy) Whoa, oh (Anne) Making friends and enemies, it's weird, but hey, it's grown on me! (Anne and Marcy) Bugs frogs, newts, and toads, gonna be a bumpy road. Flies for snacks, worms for lunch, I think I actually love this swamp! It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! Find a way to start again, brush off the dirt and make some friends! It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! I feel at home in a place that shouldn't be real! Crazy strange, but it's no big deal!
(Anne and Marcy continue singing and playing their instruments. From backstage, Sasha smiles from seeing them enjoy themselves.)
Mayor Toadstool: Well, it's certainly charming. I just hope there's a very cool guitar solo about to drop.
Anne: Here goes.
(Sasha comes onstage and starts playing an impressive solo with her axe-beetle. Anne and Marcy look surprised and happy.)
All Three Girls Singing: Ohhhhhh It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! I feel at home in a place that shouldn't be real! (Anne) Killer birds, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Sasha) Riding snails, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Marcy) Eating flies, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Anne) Finally me, and it's no big deal!
(Song ends. Crowd cheers. Both Toadstool and Duckweed give their act an 8.)
Anne: Sasha, that was awesome. I'm so psyched you joined us.
Sasha: Me too! Sorry it took so long.
(Toadie whispers something in Mayor Toadstool's ear.)
Mayor Toadstool: I've just been informed that the next act has been canceled. So give it up for your final contestant, Grimetime!
(Grime enters the stage, laughing maniacally.)
Polly (switches the spotlights to Grime): Aw, heck yeah!
(He has an ominous-looking statue with him. He opens it, and it's revealed to be a harp. The crowd gasps.)
Grime: Ahem. This piece is dedicated to the serenity of nature.
(Grime plays his harp beautifully and continues to do so)
Anne (in awe along with Sasha and Marcy): WOAH!
(3 hours later, by the end of his act, the whole crowd, including Anne, Marcy, and Sasha, are crying.)
Mayor Toadstool: Well, I've seen enough. Grime wins!
(Mayor Toadstool and Duckweed both rate his performance with a 10/10.)
Grime: (laughs) Yes! Yes!
Marcy: Sorry we lost, Sash.
Sasha: You know, as much as it pains me to lose, it was worth it have so much fun with you guys up there.
Mayor Toadstool: Alright, folks, gather round. I got one more announcement. Now, as I understand, you three girls will be leaving us soon?
Anne: Yup. With the box charged, we'll be heading to Newtopia tomorrow for the king to send us home. Everyone, you've all done so much for me, and I'll miss you more than you could ever know.
Mrs. Croaker: Aw, shucks.
Anne: Hey, before I go, can we take a group photo?
Mayor Toadstool: Heck, yeah! Everybody, line up!
(Cut to everyone around the town statue, ready to take a picture. Sprig is setting up Anne's phone for it.)
Anne: Sprig, come on! Hurry, hurry!
(Photo is taken.)
(The episode begins with Wartwood in a state of disrepair then the screen moves down to show all of its citizens living in an underground community.)
Toadie: (Carrying a bag of coins) Aren't these worthless, sir?
Mayor Toadstool: That don't mean we don't have to count them, Toadie.
(whirring)
(groans)
Maddie and Polly: (both laughing) (barks)
Sprig: Oooh. A corpse-maker moth. (clears throat) You're supposed to kiss when you see one, otherwise your crops will be cursed for seven years. (pecks Ivy's cheek) Just to be safe.
Ivy: (chuckles) Crops are very important.
(shrieks)
(grunting)
Sprig: Whoa! Nice shot.
(bell tolling)
Sprig: Oop. sound like the mission briefing bell.
Ivy: Come on! (sees the seats are full and groans) There's no seats left together.
Sprig: Attention, fellow freedom fighters. Will someone give up their seat for Sprivy, Wartwood's cutest couple?
(giggles)
Loggle: Not this again.
Mrs. Croaker: (scoffs) Young love is the worst.
Ivy: No takers, hey? Hmm. Guess we'll just stand in the back together.
Sprig: As long as we're together.
(all groaning, murmuring)
Sasha: Good morning, everyone. Wait. Is it morning? It's hard to tell underground. Whatever. We've got good news and bad news.
Grime: Good news is we've secured a major shipment of crucial supplies from a wealthy pro-Wartwood elite.
(all cheering)
Anne: But the bad news is the only way to Wartwood is through the mountain pass, and Andrias has it locked down, guarded by a giant laser cannon.
Laser cannon stinks.
Wally: I like the other news better!
Anne: Why does Grime always get to do the good news?
Sasha: The cannon is protected by a force field. If we can take that out, we can destroy the weapon. There's a robot battalion protecting both structures. But every hour, there's a five-minute window where the robots change shifts. That's our chance to strike.
Loggle: Wait. The robots change shifts?
Mrs. Croaker: Everyone deserves a break, Loggle.
Sasha: I'm bringing two teams of two. One for the shield generator, one to take out the cannon before the five minutes are up. Stumpy, Fern, Ivy, and Sprig, follow me.
Stumpy: Looks like our number's up.
Sprig: Ha! Of course they want the two of us.
Ivy: Yeah, after all, we're perfectly in sync.
(both laugh)
Anne: All right. Well, that's the only mission today, so what do you guys wanna do?
Wally: Can we have a pinata party?
(Anne and Grime glance at each other surprised.)
Grime: Don't see why not.
(As if on cue, a pinata of Andrias falls from the ceiling as mariachi music plays. Everyone cheers and start wailing on the pinata with sticks.)
Sasha: Okay, so the teams are, Sprig with Stumpy, and Ivy with Fern.
(both gasp)
Sprig: Uh... (chuckles)... Sasha, shouldn't me and Ivy be partners?
Ivy: He means 'cause we're dating.
Sasha: (sighs) Listen, twerp and twerpette, you're not here to pass notes and play footsie. You're here to do a job. And these pairings are super important to the mission.
Sprig: (sobbing) What will I do without you?
Ivy: I'll miss you every second.
Sasha: (rolls her eyes) Good Lord!
(chitters)
Stumpy: This one is for bashing and smashing.
Uh...
Stumpy: This one is for slicing and dicing.
Fern: Wow. I wish my hands were scissors. Working at the salon would be a breeze.
Stumpy: Aye, lass, but then you'd never be able to caress a wee baby tadpole. Or hold hands with the love of your live!
Fern: Seems worth it to me!
I can't believe we have to split up.
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to anyone.
There's gotta be a way to switch, as long as Sasha doesn't find out.
(bird shrieking)
Sasha: All right, there's our target. And our supplier is just on the other side of the pass. I'll keep watch up here, and signal him when the cannon is down.
(grunting)
Sasha: Sorry, cheerleading muscle memory. Here's a watch for each of you. The shift change is about to start. Follow my plan exactly and it should just be enough. Okay, team, move out!
(all grunting)
Mail Frog:  Delivery for Wartwood Delivery today 
Mail Frog:  Delivery for Wartwood Delivery delayed 
Geez.
Oh! Hey, guys. I forgot.
Sasha gave me this note.
Something about switching up the teams.
That sound important, Sprig.
Let us read it together.
"Dear nerds,
I, Sasha, order you to switch partners.
Sprig should be with Ivy since they're dating."
Hmm.
Well, it certainly sounds legit.
Let's switch it up then. Sasha is a tactical wizard.
Mucking about with her decisions could have devastating consequences.
(whistle blowing)
Shift change.
(both grunt)
(kisses)
(grunting)
(whirring)
Boom! Now, all we've got to wait for that force field to come down.
Uh, boy.
Don't know why old Stumpy was picked to go uphill.
This sure is a hand climb.
You doing okay back there, Fern?
Look, Cutsy, that "cloud" looks like a cloud. (chuckles)
(Stumpy) Fern, get a move on!
(sighs)
We finally made it.
Now, let's shut down this generator with no one the wiser.
(beeping)
Oh, dear frog!
(siren blaring) On your guard, Fern!
(screams)
Hmm, think the shield is down yet?
Let's check!
-(electricity crackles) -(screams)
Ouch!
Huh, it's still up.
Well, we can't expect Fern and Stumpy to work as good together as we do.
Good call. (grunts)
Let's give them a little extra time.
You wanna work on our couple's dance routine?
Which one?
(upbeat music playing)
(both panting)
Nailed it!
(sighs) Okay, only two minutes left.
Let's try this one more time.
(electricity crackles) (screams)
(grunts)
It hurts so much.
You thinking what I'm thinking? Try the shield again?
No. Stumpy and Fern are in trouble.
Come on!
Fern, Stumpy!
What happened?
Sprig, I think it might be a--
Ambush!
(screams) (grunts)
Yeah, like, what he said.
(screams)
This was not in the mission briefing!
Holy crab! (grunts)
(both grunting)
(both gasp, scream)
(screams)
(all panting)
(all screaming)
(grunts)
Only one minute left and this mission's a bust!
We're done for!
(all grunting)
Look! That's where the generator is getting its power.
Fern, if I can keep that thing busy, can you cut those wires and shut it down?
Gladly.
Sprig, take Stumpy to the cannon!
Me and Fern will get the shield sown.
Right! Let's go, Stumpy. And, Ivy...
(sobbing) ...I'll miss you so much.
I'll count every second until we're back together.
And not judt 'cause I have to for the mission.
Oh, for Pete's sake! We're going!
No, Ivy! I miss you already!
I think that guy likes you.
(whirring)
(raspberry)
Ha!
Looks like you're due for a cut!
(screams)
Okay, let's see if these shields are still up.
I wouldn't recommend that.
-(electricity crackles) -Oh, yeah.
Your spatula hand is made out of bone.
That doesn't conduct electricity.
So that's why Sasha picked you.
Come on, girls. Come on!
Let's lower them ears!
And done!
Dang! That looks good.
(powering down)
(shield powering down)
It's down! Go time!
(door squeaks)
Looks like five oughta do the trick.
Oh, no!
The new shift? We're too late!
You do your job, Stumpy,
and let me do mine.
(beeping)
That should do it.
Let's get out of here, kid.
Yes!
Nice work, guys. Looks like the mission was a success.
Actually, Sasha...
You and Ivy ignored my orders and almost beefed the entire mission
because you couldn't spend five minutes apart?
That is... surprisingly accurate.
I separated you two because I needed two of our best commandos
protecting two of our best specialists,
so they could do their jobs.
(both) Oh!
Oh, yeah! Oh, I see.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yep, we're dumb.
But you still managed to pull off the mission.
So I'm only sort of furious.
Hey, Sprig. I really like where our relationship is headed, but...
Maybe we shouldn't let it dictate every decision we make in our lives?
Yep. Wait, you guys are dating?
And I'm glad y'all learned your lessons
and we ain't dead.
Cheerio, my good frogs.
The Ribbiton state is here to pledge its full support for your rebellion.
Thanks, Wigbert. Your supplies are really going to make a difference.
What the...
(In the resistance's base, Mrs. Croaker, Wally, Loggle, Maddie, and Toadie have gathered to meet with Anne and Sasha for a mission debriefing. Toadie is the only one who isn't wearing new edgy clothing.)
Sasha: Listen up, soldiers. The Marauders have intercepted our latest shipment of weapons.
- (booing) - How could they?
Anne: Sorry. (Chuckles) Marauders?
Sasha: A gang of dirty, anarchist frogs who don't work for Andrias or the rebellion. They hijack caravans, raid villages for scraps and are basically a huge, unwashed thorn in my side.
Can't we just smack 'em down?
There are too many of 'em to take head-on.
Sasha: Bingo.
Anne: Whoa.
Sasha: So, we're gonna sneak into their camp and steal our stuff back.
- Diabolical. - Thieving from the thieves?
Wally: I love dramatic irony!
Sasha: Croaker, you and your team come up with the battle strategy. Me and Anne are gonna go grab the gear.
(chirps)
Mrs. Croaker: All right, you miserable layabouts, listen up.
Toadie: (clears throat) Uh, hey. (Record scratches) Before we start, does anyone want a Post-it note? Can't have a good meeting without Post-it notes.
Mrs. Croaker: (sighs) Okay, here's the plan. Loggle and Maddie, you're with me. Wally and Toadie, you're on offense. We keep the pressure on until Anne and Sasha are out with the goods. Now gear up. We leave in three!
Toadie: Um, Mrs. Croaker? (feet screech) As much as I'd like to be on offense with Walliam, I'd be much more comfortable as the...
Mrs. Croaker: Lookout! Again? Toadie, this is our team's sixth mission, and all you ever wanna do is organize the meetings and be the lookout!
Wally: (chuckles) It's what I'm good at! Direct physical confrontation, not so much. (screams) Oh, my gosh! I blew up Maddie!
Maddie: You wish. Sup?
Toadie: (screams)
Mrs. Croaker: Listen, Toadie. The world has changed, and we've had to change with it.
(grunting)
(whistling)
Mrs. Croaker: Don't you wanna step out of your comfort zone, become something more than the vest-wearing pencil pusher you've always been?
Toadie: But my comfort zone is so comfy.
Mrs. Croaker: Well, I think you're capable of so much more.
Toadie: Nope! Back to the comfort zone!
Huh?
(wind whistling)
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
Who cares? Let's get our stuff and go.
- (cackles) - (shouts)
(Marauder) We got you.
They fell for it. Get 'em!
Shoot! Head for the rendezvous!
(both grunt)
(clamoring)
(grunting)
Whew!
That was clo... Oh, no!
Where's everybody else?
(marauders chuckling)
Anne: The others got caught! We gotta get back down there.
Sasha: Absolutely not.
Anne: What? Why not?
Sasha: We might just get captured ourselves, and the resistance can't lose both its leaders.
Anne: Then what do we do?
Sasha: Just wait. Croaker's team is pretty tough. There's a chance they'll escape on their own.
Anne: (sighs) Fine. What should we do till then?
Sasha: We'll train.
(Back at the Marauders' camp, Mrs. Croaker's team is locked in a cage, with the Marauders cackling. The leader walks up to them.)
Leader: Well, well, what do we have... (removes his helmet, revealing himself to be Barry) here?
Mrs. Croaker: Barry? The candy man? You run the Marauders?
Barry: Dang right, I do. Turns out I've got a sweet tooth for anarchy.
What are you gonna do with us, you sicko?
Barry: We're going to sell you sugarplums to Andrias' army. They pay extra for resistance frogs.
- (all gasp) - You help Andrias?
What are you, insane?
Barry: Look around you, toots. The whole world is insane, but that suits us, don't it, Brian?
Brian: I used to be a tax accountant. Now I drink the blood of my enemies and eat dessert for breakfast.
Barry: See? Turns out the end of the world is sweet! (Cackles)
(all cackling)
Toadie: Well, nothing left to do but accept our fate. Anyone want a Post-it note for their will?
Loggle: (sobbing) No! I'm too beautiful to die!
Get it together! Here's the plan:
I'll get a guard's attention and take him out.
Maddie, unlock the cell.
To a die and I will take the Marauders on the ground
while you all get the stolen weapons.
Then Wally blasts us an exit.
- Got it? - (all) Got it!
Uh, Mrs. C.?
(shouts) Fine! Toadie, you're the lookout!
Now let's do this.
Excuse me, youngster.
I'm a little confused. Where am I?
Back off the bars, lady. You're in Marauder jail.
Now, if I've been helpful to you, can you please
fill out this comment card?
(growls)
(shouts) G-G-Guys. Incoming. Incoming.
Uh, come on, Toadie. You can do this.
Excuse me, sir,
but I am going to ask you kindly
to please stop what you are doing.
Hey, that wasn't so har...
Shut up, tadpole.
(To a die screams)
(grunts)
Oh, that's not good.
Anne: (groans) Haven't we waited long enough? We've gotta get down there.
Sasha: (chuckles) Come on, Anne. It hasn't even been 30 minutes. Give it a little more time.
Anne: Easy for you to say.
Sasha: What do you mean by that?
Anne: I-It's nothing. On your left.
(all cackling)
(sighs) I knew I should have stayed in the old comfort zone.
Instead, I made things worse.
Oh, man. She's out cold.
We need a plan, and we need it now. So what do we do?
I could craft dolls to curse the Marauders
in a few hours or days.
What if we just did a bunch of push-ups to get the brain juices flowing?
I've got it. Just get me to the boomshrooms.
- And then? - That's it. Just get me
to the boomshrooms.
What were we talking about again?
I just need a strand of their hair!
I knew I should have brought me own boomshrooms!
- I've got a barrel of them. - Or a toenail.
- Um, guys. - Only one speaker at a time.
You can't be productive, if you're not organized!
Guys. Guys!
Aw. Look who it is. The tadpole.
You having a good time?
Ooh, what do we have here?
(cackles)
No!
(cackles) And thanks for the souvenir.
That is it!
(roars)
Croaker was right!
It's time for a change.
Time for me to be uncomfortable!
(growls)
Oh, not again.
(Wally, Loggle) Wow. He's possessed.
Forget organized and productive meetings,
we just need to get it together.
Loggle, let's put those muscles to good use.
Start digging!
Maddie, you navigate us to the stolen weapons.
Wally, when we get there, you will use a few boomshrooms
to cause a distraction so we can get away!
What about you?
Me? I'm the lookout.
As in look out for my fist!
I'll be the guy who makes sure this all goes according to plan. Got it?
(all) Yes, sir!
Enough with the slapping!
(growls)
Ach, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going.
(whispering)
(laughs)
(shouts)
Sasha: Look, Anne, I'm telling you, we just have to wait.
Anne: Wait? My friends are in trouble, and here we are sparring.
Sasha: That's because we can't risk...
Anne: Getting captured. I know. I get it. And I know they're just soldiers to you, but to me they're everything.
Sasha: Anne, it isn't like that.
Anne: What was that?
Sasha: That's our cue. Come on. It's go time.
- (Marauder screams) - (Loggle shouts)
- Huh? - What the...
When you're in a meeting,
bring some pens and notepad!
(screams, grunts)
(grunts)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
(chuckles)
Oh, gumdrops! Not again!
Get back here, tadpole!
(groans)
I'll be taking this back.
Whoa! Toadie! Where'd you get those moves?
It's actually how I dress the mayor every morning.
Let's go!
Boink! (beeps)
(screaming)
Wow, Toadie. Great work out there.
Savage stuff.
Thanks, commander.
Huh. Impressive, Toadie.
I always knew you had it in you.
Not me. You kidding?
I'm still in shock.
Anne: Wow. You were right. Looks like they could
handle themselves. Hey, uh, about what I said back there...
Sasha: It's okay, but believe me, I do care about these frogs. A lot. We've been through some serious stuff together when you were gone.
(all laughing)
Sasha: But being in charge means making tough calls. And sometimes you have to stop and remember to have faith in the people around you. You taught me that.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
(all groaning)
Aw, man. They took all our stuff. Even our food!
(groans) This couldn't possibly get any worse.
What are we gonna eat now?
Mmm. (chuckles)
Barry: Holy... (crows)
Whoa.
(rumbling) Huh?
Sprig, what did you do?
It wasn't him.
Mysterious earthquakes have been wreaking havoc on the city for weeks.
Water is being diverted, tunnels have become blocked,
sunlight has even seeped in.
Sunlight? No!
(sizzling) (groans)
Have you gone out to investigate the cause?
Or asked the surface dwellers for help?
We can't go above ground. We'll burn alive.
Plus, we don't associate with your kind if we can help it.
Indeed. Insularity is how we Olms survive.
Fewer friends, sure. But also fewer foes.
I am Parisia. What do you want, outsiders?
We've come to see Mother Olm.
Mother Olm? How do you know... (sniffs)
You two! I should have known you were involved.
For bringing outsiders here, you shall be punished severely.
You should be thanking them.
King Andrias is gonna destroy Amphibia
if we don't join together and stop him.
That's none of our concern.
We will thrive down here as we always have.
By keeping our snouts out of other species business.
- (rocks crashing) - (rumbling)
(Olms screaming)
It's probably that giant drill we saw.
Andrias must be mining for something.
Got to be iron ore.
Proteus is built on a huge deposit of it.
He must want it to build more war machines.
A giant drill? War machines?
(laughs) Preposterous.
These natural tremors are nothing more than common earthquakes.
- Makes sense to me. - Uh-huh.
But what about the sunlight? How do you explain that?
Silence! Guards, dispose of these outsiders.
What about us? Give us a second chance!
No second chances.
This is the Olm way.
And stay out.
(Lysil, Angwin sigh)
Hey. I know what it's like to make a huge mistake you regret.
I'm still fighting to make up for it.
And I hope you won't give up either.
(sighs) We'll try. Easier said than done.
(rumbling) (gasps)
The drill! (grunts)
It must be getting close to the city.
We have to do something! (grunts)
Come on. I know a shortcut to the surface.
Phew. You didn't say the shortcut was full of stank beetles.
Don't worry. You'll stop smelling in five days.
Or was it five years?
All right, team. Attack plan epsilon.
What about us? We want to help too.
The sunlight's too strong. Just wait here. We got this.
All right, Plantars. Let's go.
(computer) Reaching Proteus in ten, nine...
- This thing's on autopilot. - ...eight, seven...
- Everyone try to find a way - ...six...
to shut it down.
(alarm blares)
Oh, crud. It needs a password.
Any guesses?
Try 12345!
(alarm blares) Eh, worth a shot.
(computer) Five, four, three, two...
Ugh! We're out of time.
It sounds like they're in trouble.
We can't just sit here.
Finally something we agree on. Come on!
(sizzling) (both groan)
(both) For Proteus!
(sizzling) (both groaning)
Lysil, Angwin, what are you doing?
What we have to.
Angwin, you ready?
Ready!
(both screaming)
Hold fast, Lysil!
You too, Angwin.
It's coming down. Run!
(all screaming)
(all groaning)
Everyone okay?
Lysil? Angwin?
Oh, no.
(groaning)
Guys, are you okay?
I can't believe you dove into the drill like that.
It was the only way to save the city.
Proteus will always be our home.
Even if we don't live in it.
(sniffing)
Gonna be real hard to deny the existence of that drill now.
This doesn't prove anything.
(all) What?
How do I know
you didn't fake this?
Look at Lysil and Angwin.
They nearly killed themselves to protect you and your dumb city.
Did they? Maybe they injured themselves on purpose
to make it look like they protected us.
- Yeah. - That's right.
You two, get these outsiders out of our city.
Argh!
You are the biggest moron I have ever met!
(echoing) Excuse me?
Whoa. Sash, I don't think that's a good I...
I don't care anymore, Anne!
Lysil and Angwin bent over backwards
to prove they deserved a second chance.
But this snooty despot and her crummy town aren't worth it.
Come on, guys. If these idiots wanna perish in denial,
that's their business.
Let's get out of here.
Hmm.
Don't worry, you two.
If this city won't have you, Wartwood will.
- We will? - (Parisia) Not so fast!
You dare insult Parisia, the guardian of Proteus,
who has ruled over the city for thousands of years?
Impressive.
You've all got guts.
Especially the fur-clad one.
(all) Huh?
I haven't been yelled at like that
for about 500 years,
and it kinda shook me up.
I don't know what's going on topside,
but maybe it's better to be safe than sorry.
You shall meet Mother Olm.
Hang on. What about Lysil and Angwin?
Ugh. Fine.
They shall be granted access to the city.
- Yes! - Yay! - You won't be sorry!
Under constant supervision.
Boo. Oh, that's lame.
Oof. Oh, okay.
Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
Yes, yes. Don't make me regret it.
Now then, follow me.
(sighs) Okay. This is getting old.
Guess you might as well teach me your "special" toad tactics.
We actually do call them special toad tactics,
so sarcasm denied.
Dang it!
(grunting)
(straining)
(grunting)
Ah!
(grunting)
(grunts)
Ah!
I said tense your abs. Tense them!
(groans) This isn't working.
You think?
Your small frog body
is too frail for traditional toad conditioning.
Then maybe I don't need to fight like a dumb toad.
Say "dumb toad" again.
Dumb toa--
(yells, grunts)
That's it! I'm outta here.
I'll figure out how to beat Beatrix on my own!
No, you won't.
And now it won't be my fault when you get maimed.
How did I lose to that brat?
Take that! (grunts)
And that! And this!
Huh?
(slurps) Ah, it's honey.
(rumbling)
(growling)
(screams) Oh, crud!
I'm smack-dab in the middle of a hybeena nest!
-(hybeenas snarling) -(screams)
(yells)
-(grunts) -(hybeenas whimper)
Grime? How did you find me?
I heard your shrill, annoying yell from across the forest.
Hurtful, but okay.
(hybeenas growling)
(hybeenas whimpers)
That speed. It's actually impressive.
Oh!
(hybeenas snarling)
(groaning)
(yells)
Whoa! (grunts)
-(Grime grunting) -(hybeenas snarling, whimpering)
(both) Whoo!
(sighs) Good battle.
Yeah. We whooped their little bee booties.
I gotta say,
you pack a lot of speed and accuracy in that tiny body.
(chuckling) And you!
You took that hit and gave it back to them twofold.
How'd you do that?
Toads are trained from a very young age to let rage give you strength.
It funneled correctly, it can be a secret weapon!
Wow, that's pretty cool.
(bird cawing)
Maybe I could learn a thing or two from you.
Yes.
And I think maybe I've been training you all wrong.
Instead of molding you into the perfect toad,
I should be focusing on your strengths as a frog.
Speed, agility,
being annoying.
Well, Grimothy, wanna give this whole thing another shot?
Indeed.
But call me Grimothy again and I'll eat you alive.
(chuckles) Wow.
(rock music playing)
Uh...
Hmm.
(grunting)
Hachi machi! Ooh!
Grime! Are you okay?
Whoo!
You're ready.
(crowd cheering)
 Kickin' butt And takin' names 
 We're the school They call Saint James! 
You didn't even rewrite the song?
I'm very busy, Hop Pop!
Whoa!
(both grunt)
Here you go, bud. Looking intimidating.
What do you think, big guy? Do I have a chance here?
Realistically, no.
But you frogs always surprise me.
So, like, a 5% chance?
(crowd booing)
Don't worry, little frog. I'll make this quick.
We'll see who's quick.
-(bell rings) -Begin match!
(yells)
(grunting)
(overlapping grunting)
Can't dodge every hit!
All that speed, but no strength behind it.
This is why you don't stand a chance!
(distorted, yells) What the--
(Beatrix) I've never seen this before.
From frog or toad.
That's because it's frog and toad!
(yells)
(Beatrix grunting)
Impressive, but you forget one thing.
We toads love a good wrestle!
-(crowd gasps) -Sprig!
-(laughs) -(Sprig strains)
Looks like you've let everyone down, frog,
surprising no one.
(crowd gasping)
(Grime) Let rage give you strength.
If you funnel it correctly, it can be a secret weapon.
(groaning)
(groaning) What? What the--
(yells)
(Beatrix grunts)
(grunts)
(crowd gasps)
-Sprig wins! Sprig wins! -(bell rings)
(crowd cheers)
Whoo!
That was amazing, dude!
Well, I couldn't have done it without Grime's training.
Dang right.
(laughs)
No, I'm totally kidding.
-Great job, Sprig. -(Sprig laughs)
(Beatrix) Ahem!
I have to admit,
that frog-toad fighting style really was impressive.
Perhaps our armies united will be stronger as well.
Commander, I pledge my troops to fight for the resistance.
Wow! Who would've thought?
Frogs and toads on equal footing.
I know this undercuts the lesson,
but it's too good to pass up.
You got beat by a frog!
Beatrix lost to a frog.
A puny little-- (grunts)
Okay. See you when the war starts.
(all groaning)
We need to find Bessie.
(chirping)
(grumbling)
Hang on, girl!
-(Apothecary Gary) Not so fast. -(all gasp)
(screaming)
You have yo admit this is all pretty cool.
See how versatile plants can be?
(all) Not the time, Hop Pop!
Well, Plantars, are you ready...
-(beeping) -...to be fertilizer?
Hold on, can anyone hear that?
Kind of an obnoxious beeping sound?
Resistance base located. Extermination team deployed.
Oh, hey. When did that get there?
Extermination team? What the heck is that?
(rumbling)
(both scream) It burns us!
(all screaming)
Our precious plants! No!
I know a golden opportunity when I see one.
Come on, guys!
(villagers screaming)
Well, that worked out.
Yeah, sure did.
(sighs)
You wanna go back and help them, don't you? Yes, please.
(groans)
Don't hurt me. I'm just a cute little beetle!
(grunts)
Hyah!
Plantars? You're back?
Yes. Burn!
(screeching)
We'll help too!
Charge!
(groaning)
(groaning)
(all panting)
Dang, Gary. That was some incredible coordination.
Thanks. It comes with the whole hive mind situation.
You and your kids fight well too.
What can I say? We've had a lot of practice.
Okay, well, I think, um...
We're still going to try and kill you guys.
Yeah, let's just go with that. Attack!
Gary, wait! I know we've had some bad history.
You tried to enslave my hometown,
and I violently murdered you that one time.
-Yes. Yes, you did. -But your skills
as a botanist and farmer are undeniable!
(chuckles) Oh, stop. You're making me blush!
My whole life, I've been lookin' for folks
who care about farming as much as I do.
And, well, here you are!
Won't you join our Resistance
and help us take down King Andrias?
Well, I don't know...
Gary, if we don't do something,
the village will always be under threat.
That's right! They know the location of your willage now.
That's a good point.
And Gardenton is so isolated,
I had no idea how bad it was out there.
Well, Hopediah, you can count on us!
Let us know when and where to be, and we will be there.
I cannot believe this is happening. Ditto.
Hey, Gary, one more thing.
Andrias has been using these mind-control collars,
and we think they're utilizing spores similar to yours.
Huh? Then that means there must be at least one more of me out there.
Oh, that's amazing!
And who knows? Maybe it's a lady mushroom.
That's not a thing.
Yes. (chuckles) Well, everyone knows that.
Okay, see ya around!
(wind whistling)
(clears throat) So, anyone else lovin' the feel of these dresses?
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Heck yeah!
Mm-hmm. A guy can really breathe in these.
Anne: Those newts and toads are wearing Andrias armor. How could anyone choose to be on Andrias's side?
Sprig: Ugh, those traitors!
Anne: Wait a second. Who's that?
(both) Huh?
Please, kind soldiers, I've twisted my wee ankle and could use some help.
(gasps) Hey, you okay there, little guy?
(drinking)
(screaming)
(soldiers scream)
Wow! Rebel newts!
Awesome. Let's see if they'll join us.
(bandits growl)
Whoa! We're on the same side!
(Tritonio chuckles) I'm on no one's "side" but my own!
Anne: Wait. I know that voice. Tritonio. I should have known.
Well, well, well, if it isn't two of my best pupils. Still have my family sword, Anne?
Why don't you come over here and find out?
Charming. Well, we had a great "ha ha" catching up, but we're in a hurry. Lil Louise, relieve these two of theire supplies.
Typical. The world is falling apart, and you're still just looking out for yourself.
Mr. Tritonio!
How'd I do?
Excellent, my little JoJo Potato!
Ooh, and I heard those soldiers say there's gonna be
an ever bigger caravan passing through the woods at three o'clock.
Ah, great recon work, JoJo.
But Mr. Tritonio,
how will we get past the giant, collared beasts that guard the caravan?
Ugh, not those things again. They were such a pain last time.
Collared beasties, eh?
(scoffs) They're easy to take down once you know the trick.
Ah! So you've dealt with them before?
What am I saying? Of course you have!
You are the smartest, bravest pupils I've ever had!
You're buttering us up so we'll help you.
And it's working!
Come on, Anne. Let's help them!
Fine. But only if you promise to join the Resistance afterwards.
Done! And no backstabbing,
double-crossing or other such deception.
You wound me, Anne!
Come my friends. To the secret hideout!
Wait. Before we go, what's up with the tights?
Reduces friction. We run faster.
(grunting)
And we look amazing.
(merry band) Amazing!
I shouldn't have asked.
(jig playing)
So, why do they call you Lil Louise?
You're gigantic!
That's the joke.
(chews) Eh, I don't get it.
(Tritonio) And voila! Hmm?
We ride away from the caravan, victorious.
Wow. You have a real talent for strategy.
Too bad you're a no-good, backstabbing scallywag.
You'd be a scallywag too, if you grew up like me.
I was born a street urchin, no family, no one to look out for me.
(squeals)
I learned to survive by joining whatever street crew I crossed paths with.
But alas, living on the street
meant loyalty was thin. (cackling)
(whispers, indistinct)
(whistling)
Young Tritonio: Oh!
Jerry: Oh, you okay, little guy?
Jerry: Hey! What are you doin'?
(coins jingling)
Jerry: Get back here!
Young Tritonio: Wait for me!
(bandits chuckle) (jail cell closes)
Tritonio: (narrating) When things get bad, it's always everyone for themselves.
Anne: You're telling me, if push came to shove, you'd even leave these guys in the dust?
(merry band) Ooh! (whistling)
It is tha law of the streets: no loyalties, no attachment.
Ah, it is time.
The caravan shall be passing through in mere minutes.
Let's go!
Hey, slither brains! The dum-dum convention is two miles that way.
That is so rude.
Guards!
(hissing)
Catch us if you can.
(hissing)
Hey, who's up there? (shouts)
(whistles)
(Lil Louise) Now let's see what kinda loot we just scored.
(cackling) Ha ha, ha ha, gotcha, gotcha.
(gasps) It's a sting!
No!
Tritonio, you have to help them!
Farewell, my friends.
No! Dang it.
(shouts)
(owl hoots)
(sighs)
Tritonio, come on! We can still save them.
And risk capture ourselves?
No can do, kids.
The rules of the street, remember?
No attachments. No regrets.
But what about the Resistance? You said y--
Oh, come on, Sprig. You know I was never going to do that.
Sheesh. Okay. Dang.
Dios mio! (Anne) Look, dude.
If you wanna abandon your friends,
who you clearly adore, that's your call.
But it kills me to see you leave like this.
If you grew up how I did...
I get that. We do what we need to do to survive.
But I gotta say, for a "master thief," I'm disappointed in you.
-How so? -You're leaving the best loot in the world on the table.
Friendship, comrades, someone to count on.
By throwing those things away, you're only robbing yourself.
Come on, Sprig. We have a very merry band to save.
Right behind you.
Later, Tritonio.
(sighs)
This way!
There they are.
In the name of the King, I find you guilty of disturbing the peace.
To which there is only one punishment.
Hey, ya metal freaks! Permission to approach the bench?
(battle cry)
Voila! (all gasp)
(all battle cry)
Order! Order!
There will be order in my court!
(all) Huh?
Oh, no.
Deploying corporal punishment!
(screams)
(gasps)
No amnesty for minors!
(screams)
(shouts)
Justice is half blind!
(all gasp)
(whinnies)
(Anne, Spring) Tritonio!
Mr. Tritonio, you came back!
But what about the rules of the streets?
Ha! You think I, Tritonio, give a fig for rules?
This court holds you in contempt!
Merry band, to me!
(all) Righto!
(roars)
Legal systems failing.
(screams)
Gotcha!
(merry band cheering)
Three cheers for the greatest newt of them all!
Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!
Toss me higher! Higher, I say!
Our hero!
(chattering)
(chuckling)
Some victory gruel, senora?
Thanks, Tritonio. So, what happened to "no loyalties"?
Uh, I just happened to be passing by,
and my arrow flew out of my bow!
What are the odds? Mm-hmm.
Face it, Big T. It feels good to have someone's back.
(all laughing) Yeah, maybe.
Listen. Being on your own may have worked before,
but the fate of Amphibia rests on whether we can defeat Andrias.
Yeah! The Rebellion could really use folks like you on our side.
Sasha keeps saying we need help with our battle strategy.
And who's better at strategy than you?
(scoffs) I know you're just buttering me up so I'll help you.
Well, I learned from the best.
I gotta say, uh,
you're not the same girl I met all those months ago.
All right. We're in!
Henceforth the Rebellion shall be our new crew.
(cheering)
(Anne) Good news, Sasha!
We just recruited the top newt strategist. That's awesome!
Now come follow me, Hop Pop just found something really interesting.
Oh, there you are.
So I, uh...
I got lost while looking for the bathroom
and found this strange-looking door.
There's no telling what could be in there.
Trouble is, we can't figure out how to open it.
There's no knob or handle.
Just this like, book-sized slot.
Book-sized?
Hop Pop, have you tried sliding the family tome into it?
The one that had the Calamity Box drawings inside?
It's worth a shot. Lemme go get it!
(gears whirring)
(rumbling)
(all gasp)
Hmm.
It says...
nothing! It's blank.
Well, this is disappointing.
Our family sure was mysterious.
r?
Thanks, everyone!
I just have to bust her out of a mountain-top fortress,
so I shouldn't be gone long.
I still think this is a terrible idea.
What if we save her, and she tears you to shreds?
Domino 2 would never hurt me.
I just know. I feel it in my heart.
(sighs) All right.
Well, count me in.
Thanks, dude. Appreciate the help.
I mean, someone's gotta watch your back when this goes horribly wrong.
(Anne) We really need to work on your pep talks.
(all meow)
Wally, you take first watch. And be careful.
Aye, aye, ma'am. I'll guard the prisioners with me life.
If you little blighters know what's good for you,
you won't try anything! (meows)
Oh, no! No! Stay back. Stay back!
Stay back! (echoes)
Take a look. Another one of King Andrias's robot bases.
(Sprig) They're isung the moths to generator power.
And look! Mind-control collars.
(buzzer rings)
(powers down)
Okay, here's the plan:
We'll wait for the moths to fall sleep,
and then we sneak in and free my baby precious.
Anne, there are dozens of moths. How are you gonna find--
She's right there.
Oh. Huh. Nice.
(Anne) Now come on. Let's motor.
I'll call you Cali-coco, and Nutgrass, and Josey-Pie,
and of course, little Wally Jr.!
(Mrs. Croaker) Wally?
What's going on in here?
(chuckles) Nothing!
I'm just, uh, passing time with my accordion!
(meowing)
Wally, that...
is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
Aw, lemme hold one!
(meows, purrs) (chuckles) Hey, they're friendly.
(chuckles) And this one is a...
(hisses) ...cute little warrior!
Get off me, you disgusting, little...
dear.
Oh.
You fools!
Quick, shield your eyes!
Don't look at 'em! That's how they get ya!
(meows)
(man vocalizing)
"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."
(moths snoring)
(sniffing)
(grunts)
(snoring)
Shh. Wait there.
Come on, stupid thing.
Uh-oh. (roars)
Oh!
Stop right-- (screams)
(growls)
Anne, look out! Run!
(roars) No, I can't leave her!
(Anne screams)
Anne, get away!
No. She'll remember me. I know it.
Come on, girl.
(roars)
Or maybe I'm wrong. (screams)
(purrs) (laughs)
Ow!
I don't believe this. She does remember you!
Huh. Big win for blind faith.
(meows)
Domino 2,
you didn't forget me.
(purring) Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl?
(sniffles) Wow. This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my--
(growls) I'm about to get eaten, aren't I?
(gulps)
(shrieking)
Sprig! Hang on, buddy!
Okay, how do we do this?
Domino 2, up, up and awa--
(screams)
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, no!
Ah, nuts.
(grunts, screams)
(roars)
(strains)
Whoa!
Whoo!
(screams)
Gotcha! Now let's get outta here!
(clanks)
What's wrong, girl?
(coos)
You're right. We can't just leave them here.
I mean, we could.
Sprig. Okay, okay.
(grunting)
(meows)
Looks like we did it.
(screams) Sprig!
(screams)
(screams)
-(Sprig screams) -(moths meow)
There is definitely not enough me to go around!
Sprig, no!
(roars)
(groans)
Th-- Thanks.
Why did they listen to her?
No way.
Sprig, Marcy told me about animals like this.
Domino 2 must be the alpha moth!
So that means, if we've tamed Domino...
Yep! We've tamed 'em all!
Whoo-hoo! Follow me, everyone!
Yeah!
(kittens meowing)
Oh, Lenny Long Bottom, you filled the spider-sized hole in my heart.
No one's ever gonna take these babies away from us.
Oh, no! Look!
You stay away from them!
You want 'em, you gotta get through us!
Hey, everyone! You could put your weapons down. They're with us now!
(all) Huh?
With us?
Well, guys, looks like we just got air calvary!
(all cheering)
Sasha: Listen up! Our spies tell us that Andrias plans to invade Earth in just a few days. So it's time for our rebellion to mobilize!
(everyone cheers)
Grime: We're ready!
Polly and Sprig: Oh yeah!
Anne: Which means, it's time for us to join up with our newt and toad allies. Woooo!
(everyone stops cheering and are disappointed)
Wally: Did you say newts... and toads... coming here... to work with us?!
Sasha: Yeah. What's the problem?
Hop Pop: Historically frogs, toads, and newts haven't really gotten-
Grime (interrupting): What Hop Pop is trying to say is that things will be tense.
Anne: Really? But Duckweed's a newt, Toadstool's a toad, and you two have been happily living in Wartwood for years.
(Duckweed and Toadstool look at each other for a second.)
Duckweed: Eh, define happily.
Mayor Toadstool: That's definitely had its bumps.
Sasha: I don't believe this. You're telling me we spent all this time building this giant army and there's a chance you guys won't work together?
Hop Pop: We're just saying there's an extremely high possibility of that, yes.
(Sasha gets mad at this reaction.)
Anne: Cheer up, Sash. You're forgetting that I happen to be excellent at brokering peace between feuding factions.
Sasha: I... (gets very confused) whaaaat?
Anne: Hello? I brought the track team and band geeks together that one time to put on the school dance.
(cut to a photo showing a team track player and a band geek agreeing to the decision as Anne points to the agreeing hands happily)
Anne (offscreen): Only award I've ever gotten.
(back to the Resistance)
Sasha: Oh yeah. By pointing out they both value proper lung control.
Anne: Getting these guys together will be a cinch. You'll see. We just need to find those connection points.
Sasha: You better be right. We don't have much time and a lot is riding on this.
Toadie: (enters) Madame, generals. They're here.
(An army of toads and an army of newts march. As they stop marching, the army of Newts are led by Tritonio Espada while the army of toads are led by Captain Beatrix)
Sasha: Beatrix! Tritonio! Welcome!
Beatrix (jumps out of the ant vehicle on top): Enough pleasantries! I agree to fight alongside you frogs, but I draw the line at newts. They'll steal your sword and then stab me in the back with us.
(Jojo Potato pulls out mini wood stairs to get Tritonio down)
Tritonio: Only because you toads are too slow... (he covers his nose alongside with Jojo) ...and smelly I might add.
Beatrix: I'm gonna turn your tail into a toothpick.
Hop Pop: Hey now! Come on you two! Let's at least try to get along.
(Beatrix and Tritonio look at Hop Pop then look at each other now)
Tritonio (sarcastic): Say Beatrix, did you hear something just now?
Beatrix (sarcastic); No. Maybe a small animal squeaking somewhere.
Hop Pop (embarrassed yet a bit mad): Oh, ignoring frogs now, eh? Typical. A snobby newt and a bully of a toad. Why am I not surprised?
Beatrix: That does it! This alliance is over.
Tritonio: Toodles!
(Beatrix and Tritonio are on their respective vehicles)
Sasha: Guys, we need to work together if we're gonna stop Andrias. Let's just head down to the war room and talk through some strategies.
Tritonio: It would be a waste of time, Sasha. I mean, who can fix 900 years of conflict in a day?
Anne: (clears throat, offscreen) (onscreen) Who has two thumbs and is a neutral arbitrator who fell out of the sky? This girl! (points at herself)
(we see a photo of the band geek and the team track student agreeing again, this time upside down)
(back to the same place)
Hop Pop: It is true that you fell out of the sky.
Tritonio: The idea does have merit.
Beatrix: Fine. If Anne thinks you can moderate, we'll stay.
Tritonio: As will we.
Hop Pop: Us too.
Anne (offscreen): Hop Pop, we live here.
Hop Pop: Oh right.
Anne: Okay then. (does some anime cuteness pose) Let's start the healing.
(The newts march to enter the Resistance door as Sprig and Ivy look on. The toads are marching and are inside. An aqua green frog puts Tritonio's beetle vehicle and Beatrix's ant vehicle with Bessie)
Bessie: (chirps)
Beatrix's Ant Vehicle: (roars)
(cut to Polly at the weapon check)
Polly: Weapon check here! Weapon check. Leave a weapon, take a number.
(A toad gives his gold teeth while a newt gives a spike hammer to Polly. Much to her delight, she then puts the gold teeth in her mouth while laughing and running around with the hammer on her left hand)
(cut to the plan meeting)
Sasha: All of Andrias' power comes from this music box. So our best bet is to get it away from him.
Anne: (writing the word, spitballin', on the chalkboard) Alright friends, any ideas? Remember, this is a safe space full of chill vibes and good intentions.
(Beatrix raises her hand)
Tritonio: Oh.
Beatrix: What? I have an idea.
Tritonio: Let me guess. You want to bash in a front door, beat up anyone you see, and take the music box.
(Beatrix gets embarrassed as her cheeks turn pink)
Beatrix: Maybe.
Tritonio: Typical toad maneuver. It'll never work.
Anne: Tritonio, let's keep it positive. All ideas are welcome here.
Tritonio: Even, bad ones?
Anne: Especially, bad ones.
Hop Pop: Well uh, I have an id-
Tritonio: I propose a more intelligent approach. We take a small strike force, dress them up as orphans, sneak past the guards, and steal the box.
(Anne writes orphans on the chalkboard)
Sasha: I'm not confident that would succeed. Andrias' security is top notch and I don't think orphans are gonna trick a bunch of soulless robots.
Tritonio: With the right orphan costume you can trick anyone. It's proven.
Beatrix: HA! Now we're as bad ideas you cocky newt.
Anne (offscreen): Beatrix that's not helping.
Beatrix (blush embarrassment): Right.
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Would anyone like to hear my idea?
Beatrix: HA! A frog with a battle strategy?!
Tritonio (holding his laughter): Yes yes. What is it? Maybe paint a barn? Have a hoedown?
(Beatrix and Tritonio laugh before Hop Pop had enough)
Hop Pop: That's it!
(Hop Pop jumps out of the chair and tackles Tritonio. Beatrix then jumps and tackles both of them. Grime is enjoying this.)
Sasha: Anne, this isn't working. We need to do something.
Anne: You're right, Sash. It's time for... (distorted voice) team building exercises.
(cut to the Resistance)
Anne: (onscreen) Okay folks, listen up! (offscreen) In order to defeat King Andrias and his robot hordes, we need to work together. (onscreen) First step, is the mirror exercise. I learned this one at summer camp. Everyone gather around in a circle and (does the mirror pose) mimic my movements exactly. (Sasha mimics it)
(Hop Pop, Wally, and Mrs. Croaker does the same exact pose)
Beatrix (while she and the toads do the pose): Excuse me, what's the point of this?
Tritonio (while he and the newts do the pose): If it's to make us all feel stupid, it's working.
Anne (closing her eyes and still doing the pose): This is all about harmony, people. Can you feel it? (opens her eyes as she does a different pose) Can you feel the harmony?
Armies: Ugh!
(All of the people from armies does the same pose Anne did, before a blue toad falls making everyone fall like a domino. Anne facepalms while Sasha is in her questionable face)
(cut to the people doing another exercise)
Anne: (offscreen) Next up is the human knot... (onscreen) or in this case the human-frog-toad-newt knot thing. (Duckweed and Sasha roll their eyes) Try to untangle yourselves while holding hands.
(Sprig successfully jumps over Grime)
Sasha: Gotta twirl, Grimesy.
Grime: Hmph. (blushes in embarassment as he twirls)
(the rest of the people are trying to untangle themselves until...)
Purple Newt Soldier: Come on toad. Figure it out.
Tan Newt Soldier: Yeah, use that big brain of yours.
(The red eyebody toad soldier grabs both of them along with the frog. This leads to a big rolling ball as Anne facepalms again)
(transition to the next step)
Anne (offscreen): Next up, the three-legged race.
(a Purple Newt Soldier and a Toad Soldier look at each other very mad)
Anne: Runners on your mark, get set... (blows her whistle)
(both the blue frog and the Soldier fall while a Toad Soldier steps on the Newt Soldier's tail, leading for him to be in pain)
Green Toad Soldier: (chuckles while running)
Toadie: (screams)
Green Toad Soldier: (crosses the finish line with Toadie) WOO! YES!! (spikes Toadie like a ball) Nailed it!
(Toadie knocks over Sasha)
Anne: (sees the big rolling ball of newts, toads, and frogs) Oh no, not again!
(transition to the next step where both frogs, toads, and newts, are groaning after what happened earlier)
Anne: Next, we have the trust fall. This is the final step to knowing that you'll have each other's backs out there. Now, when I say go...
Large Toad Soldier: Go? (falls and everyone gasps)
Anne: No!
(The Large Toad Soldier hits the ground, knock over a green frog and a purple newt soldier)
Purple Newt Soldier: Way to leave your armor on, you dumb toad.
Large Toad Soldier: Well, you weaklings were supposed to catch me.
Anne: Guys, remember this is about supporting each other.
Large Toad Soldier: (offscreen) Support? (onscreen) I got support right here. (pulls a wedgie out of the Purple Newt's soldier as the newts gasps)
Green Frog: Oh, jeez!
Toads: (laughter)
(and the Tan Newt Soldier tackles the Large Toad Soldier as the newt slaps him with his tail before the toad throws him, knocking out Toadie)
Frog: That does it!
Newt: Oh it's on!
(Everyone fights except Anne and Sasha. Chaos is happening by each frog, toad, and newt)
Sasha: Oh my gosh. Anne, this is a total disaster.
Anne: They're fine. They're just blowing off steam. I mean, at least they don't have their weapons.
(fighting continues as a toad pops up)
Toad Soldier: Did somebody say weapons?
(everyone starts getting their weapons)
Anne: Noooo!
(everyone at the weapon check, Polly is happy)
Polly: Weapon! Take a weapon, leave a body.
Anne: No. Wait guys, we can talk about-
(everyone knocks out Anne)
Anne (in pain): this....
(the newt army is ready)
Tritonio (on his beetle vehicle): Newts! (pulls out his sword) To me!
(various newts pull out crossbows)
Beatrix (on her spider vehicle): Toads! (pulls out her ax) Battle formation!
(various toads pull out spiky hammers)
Hop Pop (on Bessie with his pitchfork): Come on, frogs! Uh, do the best you can.
(Toadie, Wally, and Mrs. Croaker pull out pitchforks while Loggle use his muscles)
(everyone is ready to battle each other)
(Sasha helps Anne to get up)
Anne: NO!
Hop Pop, Beatrix, Tritonio: CHARGE!!
(Everyone is ready to battle charge at each other. Sasha then looks at Anne, worried. And then...)
Anne: (activates her powers) ENOUGH!!! (jumps up while Sasha looks at her in awe)
(Anne then stops the battle before it even started)
Anne: I SAID ENOUGH!!! (uses the blue gem ability to push everyone away, everyone screaming in the process, to stop fighting)
Grime: (to Sasha): Ahem. Probably should've let you having powers there.
(Sasha looks at him)
Anne: All this time I thought I can solve your problems and heal this rift.
(a newt and a toad gasps; everyone looks at her, very shocked of what she can do with her powers)
Anne: But I was wrong. This is no quick fix. I can't solve this problem for you. (deactivates her powers and falls down softly while Sasha catches her) Only you can. So when you're ready to work together and save the world, let me know.
(Anne exits along with Sasha. The armies look at each other very guilty.)
(cut to the plan meeting room)
Sasha: Dang, Anne! You were a total boss out there.
Anne (emotional, looks at Sasha): I'm s-s-sorry Sash. I thought can help. But-but-
Sasha: Aww, Boonchuy. You did all you could. Now buck up, soldier. We'll figure out a new plan.
(a few minutes later)
Anne: Okay, maybe we could-
(Hop Pop, Beatrix, and Tritonio enter the room)
Beatrix: (clears throat) We came up with a plan!
Tritonio: Hopediah came to us and got us thinking. If Beatrix does her original plan and attack Andrias' front door...
Beatrix: ...we can draw the attention of its forces. Leaving a window for a small group to sneak in the back door and steal the music box while they're distracted.
Hop Pop, Beatrix, and Tritonio: What do you think?
Sasha: I think that's... perfect! It's just like the plan from that movie.
Anne: War of the Warlocks. That''s right! Marcy made us watch at every sleepover.
Sasha: And you came up with this together. (smiling) I thought you hated each other.
Tritonio: Well, Anne was right. We can't count on anyone else to solve our deep-rooted problems.
Beatrix: In the meantime, you have to see that we really do want the same thing to take our world back from that crazy king!
Hop Pop; We might not by able to forget the past. But if we work together, we might have a future.
(Anne and Sasha are happy about this plan result)
Sasha: Alright, then let's draw this game plan up and-
(a crash occurs)
Sasha: Whoa!
(the rest ran to see what's happening)
Beatrix: SWEET SWOBBLER SUSAN!!
(turns out, it was Mother Olm, crashing the party and coughing after crashing through a window)
Mother Olm: Hello young friends!
Anne: Mother Olm?!
Sasha: What are you doing here?
Mother Olm: I have some very important news. It's Andrias. We, Olms, can feel the tremors of his army's movement. That information about him moving out in a few days was a lie. He plans to invade Earth tonight.
(Hop Pop, Beatrix, Tritonio, and Sasha look at Anne)
Anne: Looks like it's go time. (to Sasha) You ready?
Sasha: You heard the lady. Let's move out!
Everyone (except Anne and Sasha): Yes ma'am.
(Polly and Wally hand out weapons to the soldiers, a toad soldier puts the armor on for the frog, giving themselves a thumbs up afterwards, a newt soldier ties the armor vest up to a toad soldier, also giving themselves thumbs up. Mother Olm is happy that the soldiers are gearing up to go to war. Sprig walks up to Anne)
Sprig: Is now a good time to mention that we've also allied with an army of mushroom zombies.
Anne: Let's give him a minute.
