(It's almost dawn and Anne's sitting outside the Plantar home drinking tea as the sun rises.)
(rooster crows)
Anne: (yawns) Ahh.
Sprig: Anne! Anne! Anne! An--
(Anne, continuing sipping her drink, raises her finger and Sprig stops to wait. She gulps and points for him to proceed.)
Sprig: Anne! Anne! Anne! Look what I found! A blue moon shell.
Anne: Pretty.
Sprig: Yup! And you know who's gonna love it? Ivy! Tomorrow's her birthday. And this is the perfect gift.
Hop Pop: Morning, kids! Time to start the chores. Whoa! Is that a blue moon shell? (gasps) Beautiful! You know, some frogs die never having seen one.
Polly: (laughs) Suckers!
Hop Pop: Anyway, enough dilly-dallying. Chore time! Bessie's waste ain't gonna shovel itself.
Sprig: Well, don't wanna get this thing dirty. (whistles)
Anne: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're just gonna leave that there? Someone's gonna steal it.
Sprig: No, they won't. This is Wartwood, Anne, not some den of thieves.
Anne: You could at least cover it up or something.
Sprig: I will do no such thing! I trust my community. And frankly, Anne, I pity you for not trusting yours.
Anne: Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Hop Pop: Kids, get your butts over here!
Sprig and Anne: Coming, Hop Pop.
(Sometime later, Anne and Sprig return to the front door.)
Sprig: Glad that's over with.
Anne: Well, I'm scarred for life.
Sprig: Yup. But never mind that. Look. The blue moon shell. Right where I left it. Wait. Wait a minute. What? The shell. The shell's not here. I've been robbed!
Anne: Well, I don't wanna tell you, "I told you so." But--
Sprig: (sobs) Ivy's birthday is tomorrow, and I've got nothing. (sobs, pants)
Anne: Okay, first, calm down.
Sprig: (breathes heavily)
Anne: Second, maybe we can track this thief down. Quick. Look for clues. Well, well, well. What do we have here?
Sprig: Oh, that's just waxed yarn. They sell it at the Grub and Go.
Anne: Well, then, let's grub and go there to catch our thief.
Sprig: (chuckles) Nice.
Anne: Finally, hundreds of hours of watching trash cop shows is gonna pay off.
Sprig: Cop, what?
Anne: You know. A cop, po-po, five-oh, doughnut munchers?
Sprig: Mmm.
Anne: Here. (She shows Sprig a trailer for a police show on her phone.)
(police siren wails)
Police chief: I don't care what it takes! Bring him to me, dead or alive!
(police siren wails)
Investigator 1: One knife victim without pants. We've gotta catch this sicko.
Investigator 2: So, you're a marathon runner, eh?
Investigator 1: Well, maybe this will jog your memory. Jelly-stained boxers found at the scene of the crime.
(gunshot fires)
Criminal: How'd you get my phone number?
Investigator 1: Easy.
Criminal: (gasps)
Investigator 1: I looked up "guilty" in the phone book.
Police officer: (chews donut)
Narrator: Justice is watching you.
(bullet ricochets)
Sprig: Whoa! I'm into this.
Anne: Who wouldn't be? Now let's go catch that thief.
(Anne and Sprig appear walking in town, wearing fake mustaches.)
Sprig: Ow! Whoops. Why are we wearing these again?
Anne: All the best cops have mustaches. Now, here's how it's gonna go. I'm the good cop. So I'll butter 'em up and make 'em lower their guard. Then bam-o! You come in as the bad cop and get the confession.
Sprig: Got it.
(store bell rings)
Anne: Hey, buddy. Nice little place you got here. Business good?
Teenage worker: Um, we're having kind of a rough season.
Anne: Good, good. We're here about a shell that got misplaced. Recognize any of these?
Teenage worker: Huh. Couldn't say. I see a lot of shells.
Anne (to Sprig): Psst. Hit him with the "bad cop."
Sprig: Oh, right. (To the worker) Your hair looks incredible. (grunts)
Teenage worker: Thanks. I use product.
Anne: (to Sprig): Sergeant, could I speak to you for a moment?
Anne: Sprig, that wasn't bad cop. That was sad cop. You gotta get mad, man!
Sprig: Yeah, I'm not generally a mad kid, Anne.
Anne: You gotta dig deep, dude. Think about what that thief took from you. Your shell. Your gift. Your future with Ivy. The frog of your dreams!
Sprig: (groans)
Anne: Yes. Yes, Sprig. Let it flow!
Sprig: (to the worker): (grumbles, yells) Hey, you little noodle! This blue shell, you seen it?
Teenage worker: Yes! Yes! I remember now! Out there. Late morning!
Sprig: Great. Now, who buys this string?
Teenage worker: Uh, no one except the baker, really.
Anne: The baker, huh? You have a nice day, sir. (Grabs a bag of donuts and puts a coin on the counter.) Keep the change, kid.
Teenage worker: Actually, you're short.
Anne: Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Anne: All right, same drill. Good cop, bad cop time.
Sprig: Got it.
(store bell rings)
Anne: Well, howdy there, baker. Nice pile of bricks you got here. Listen I wanted to ask you--
Sprig: (yells) Where's my shell?
Mr. Flour: (grunts)
Anne: Whoa, dude. What are you doing?
Mr. Flour: (grunts) Shell? What shell?
Sprig: This string was found at the scene of a crime. And only you use it. Talk!
Mr. Flour: (groans) I wrap my buguettes in that.
Anne: So whoever bought a loaf is a suspect.
Mr. Flour: (nodding frantically) Uh-huh.
Sprig: (grunts, hits him)
Mr. Flour: Whoa!
Sprig: I want names, you worm.
Mr. Flour: (shudders) Baker's oath. Customer list, confidential.
Sprig: Hmm. (Grabs an apron off the wall, embroidered with the words 'My Favorite Apron'.) Your favorite apron, right? Sure would be a shame if something (holds it over fireplace) happened to it.
Mr. Flour: (gasps) No, not my favorite apron.
Anne: Sprig!
Mr. Flour: (groans) Oh. Here. (Hands over list.)
Sprig: There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
Mr. Flour(hugging the apron): Oh! My baby! My baby!
Anne: Uh, sorry about that. He's new to this.
Mr. Flour(to the apron): It's okay, baby. Daddy's here.
Sprig: (loud munching)
Anne: So...that was a little too much bad cop.
Sprig: Well, we got results, didn't we?
Anne: Well, yeah. But--
Sprig: Then let's stop wasting time and find who stole my shell already! (sips) Actually, there's nothing in here.
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Stumpy?
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Croaker?
Mrs. Croaker: (shouts)
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Toadstool?
Toadie: Sir, please help me.
Toadstool: Just let it happen, Toadie.
Sprig: (grunts)
Anne: Dude, there's no one here.
Sprig: I know! I'm just fired up, Anne.
(children laugh)
Sprig: You were right. This town is a dirty cesspool of vice. (munches) Disgusting.
Anne: Look, I'm glad you're being more cautious. But I think this whole thing has gotten a little extreme.
Sprig: Justice is extreme, Anne! (pants) Besides, we only have one name left on our list. Which means...we've got our guy.
Anne(reading the name): Gunther? Who's that?
Sprig: He just moved to Wartwood. Lives out in the woods. Seemed nice. A little too nice.
Anne(looking at Gunther's house a few minutes later): Yeah. Sprig, I don't think we should--Sprig!
Sprig(knocking on the door): Gunther, open up!
Anne: Sprig!
Sprig: Come on! Help me break the door down!
Anne: Nope.
Sprig: Yep!
Anne: No! (gags) Bad frog.
(groans, yells, grunts)
(Gunther's door opens.)
Gunther: Oh, can I help you children?
Sprig: We'll be the ones asking questions.
Anne(covering Sprig's mouth): Hey. We're just a couple of curious kiddos knocking on doors and saying hello.
Gunther: Well, isn't that nice?
Anne: Yeah. Just wondering, what brings you here to Wartwood?
Gunther: Well, I'm from down south. But I had to leave due to an unfortunate misunderstanding.
Sprig: Oh. Was it because you're a criminal?
Gunther: Excuse me?
Sprig: Don't play dumb with us! We know that shell's in here somewhere! (Storms into the house.)
Gunther: Shell?
Sprig: Is it here? (Smashes vase.)
Gunther: Hey!
Sprig: Or maybe here? (Smashes carriage clock.)
Gunther: Stop that!
Sprig: Where are you hiding it? (Rips pillow.)
Gunther: Get out of my house! (growls)
Anne: Uh, Sprig, why is he changing color?
Sprig: I don't know. The only frogs who can do that are southern tusk frogs. But Gunther doesn't have any tusks.
Gunther: (Roars and sprouts tusks.)
Sprig: Oh, there they are.
Gunther: (growls)
Sprig: Think we touched a nerve there.
Gunther: I kill you!
Anne: Run!
(growls)
(pants)
(growls)
Sprig: We gotta hide somewhere. Stumpy! Stumpy! Stumpy! Stumpy!
Stumpy: What do you want?
Sprig: We're being chased.
Anne: There's a big monster.
Both: He's gonna kill us!
Stumpy: You think I'm gonna let you in here after you called me a thief?
Anne: Maybe?
(He slams the door.)
(growls)
(roars)
(yells)
Sprig: He's crazy.
Anne: You gotta let us in.
Both: He's gonna kill us.
(Mrs. Croaker slams door too.)
Anne: He's after us.
Sprig: You've gotta help.
Anne: Please let us in.
(Mr. Flour closes window.)
Sprig: Toadie, buddy.
(Toadie kicks them down the stairs.)
(both yell)
(both grunt)
Sprig: Anne, I think I did too much bad cop.
Anne: You think?
(growls)
Sprig: Then maybe it's time this bad cop goes good. (Rips off mustache.) Oh, that really hurts.
Gunther: (growls) Huh?
Sprig: Gunther, wait. I shouldn't have accused you like that.
Gunther: (growls repeatedly)
Sprig: I don't really know you. And you've never given me any reason not to trust you. I guess I just hopped to conclusions.
Gunther: (laughs) Hopped.
Sprig: (chuckles) Yeah. 'Cause I'm a frog. Well, anyways, I wanted you to have these. (Hands over the bag of donuts.)
Gunther: Aw!
Sprig: We ate most of them. But there's, like, three left.
Gunther: (groans) Thank you, child. Rage problems. You know how it is. People misjudge me all the time since I can turn into a hulking beast. And it's super annoying, hmm.
Sprig: Well, hey, I promise I won't judge you anymore.
Anne: Yeah, dude. Sorry about that.
Gunther: Ooh, chocolate. (munches)
Sprig: Actually, that's licorice.
Gunther: (groans) I hate licorice! (He starts chasing them again.)
(growls)
(both yell)
Both: (sighs)
Anne: Man, that guy was hard to lose.
Sprig: I don't believe this. Went through all that and we still haven't found the--(gasps) Shell! (The shell is sitting on the fence. Ivy drops down next to it.)
Ivy: Hey, Sprig.
Sprig: Ivy?
Ivy: I came by earlier, but I couldn't find you. But I did find this sweet blue moon shell.
Sprig: And you... took it?
Ivy: Yeah. It was a little dirty. But I took it home and polished it up. Here's it back.
Sprig: Uh, thanks.
Anne: Go get her.
Sprig: Oh, right. Happy early birthday, Ivy.
Ivy: Whoa. Thanks, Sprig. It's beautiful. But I kinda like it here. When I see it sparkle, I know I'm getting close to your place.
Sprig: (stammers) Wow! (blows raspberry) Okay.
Anne: (gasps) Aw!
Sprig: Cut it out!
Ivy: Well, see you dorks later.
Anne: See you, Ivy! Well, looks like we found our thief.
Sprig: Yes, Anne. But she didn't just steal the shell. She stole my heart.
(sweeping music plays)
(music stops)
Sprig: Too much?
Anne: Little bit, yeah.
Sprig: Got it.
