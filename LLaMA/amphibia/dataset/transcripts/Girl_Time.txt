Anne: Uh, hello? Anyone here? Well, this place seems nice.
Tuti: I help you?
Anne: (screams) Hi. Who are you?
Tuti: Am town healer, Tuti. Also part-time bounty hunter.
Polly: I like her.
Anne: Tuti, huh? Well, we're here for that full body massage.
Tuti: Full body is good. Come, we get personal.
Anne: Ooh! I'll go first. Whoa, you frogs are really flexible, huh? Are you sure you know how to massage a human?
Tuti: Is same.
Anne: (grunts and shrieks)
Polly: Whoa, mama.
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Anne(eyes watering): This is amazing. So... relaxing. Is that my foot?
Polly: And on that note, I'm out.
Tuti: Is done. You are reborn.
Anne: Polly, you are going to love this.
Tuti: Pollywog gone. You talk to no one.
Anne: (gasps) What? She ditched me? But this is all for her. (groans) I got to find her and get this thing back on track. See you, Tuti.
Tuti: Hmm.
(door opens)
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Afternoon, Tuti. Wonderin' if you've seen a couple of ol' scammers handing out these fake IOUs today.
Tuti: Scammers? Fake? (yells) Come. I lead way.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Fiery as ever, Tuti.
Wally: (burps)
Polly: (loud burp)
Wally: Dang, kid. You got the burp of a titan!
Polly: Thanks, Wally.
Anne: Hey! (panting)
Polly: Oh. Hey, Anne.
Anne: What the heck, dude? You ditched me? And now I find you rubbing elbows with the local deadbeat?
Wally: That hurt me soul.
Polly: Well, at least this guy doesn't waste my time with stuff I think is stupid and boring!
Anne: (gasps) Well, excuse me for trying to make you less of a disgusting little slob! (gasps)
Wally: (stunned)
Polly: (stunned)
Anne: Polly, I-- (stammers) That's not--I mean, what I mean is--(Screams suddenly as Tuti grabs her from behind.)
Tuti: Tuti caught thief!
Anne: Wait, what do you mean "thief"? I totally paid.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Sorry, little lady, but Hopadiah's broke. Which makes these IOUs you've been handing out totally worthless. (Steps aside to reveal Sprig and Hop Pop with handcuffs)
Anne: (gasps)
Sprig: These chains represent our burden on society!
Hop Pop: Dang it, Anne, how much did you spend?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Now pay up, or I'm gonna have to do my duty, and put y'all in debtor's prison.
Anne: We'll have to sit in a chicken coop?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Less like sittin' and more like gatherin' eggs for the town until your debt's paid off.
Anne: That doesn't sound so bad.
(screeching)
(screams)
Anne: No!
(all grunting)
Polly: You let my family go!
Anne: (gasps) That's it! Hey, mustache! Is that trophy made out of gold?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Twenty four karat, ma'am.
Anne: All right, Polly. Time to shine.
Polly: Wait, what?
Anne: Spit, dude. Spit like you've never spit before. Break that record, and save this family.
Polly: Let's do this.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Okay, little lady. You get three official chances. You ready?
(Polly spits twice, falling short.)
Villager: I don't think she's gonna make it.
Villager: It's not looking good.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Only one more chance, little lady.
Hop Pop: Something ain't right. She's not spitting at full force. Almost as if she's ashamed.
Anne: Yeah, and I think I know why. Hey, you okay?
Polly: Yeah. I guess it's just kinda hard to spit when you feel gross.
Anne: (sighs) Polly, I'm the gross one. I tried to change someone that's perfect the way they are.
Polly: You saying you were wrong?
Anne: Very wrong.
Polly: Super wrong?
Anne: Super wrong.
Polly: You're always wrong?
Anne: I'm always--Hey, not always.
Polly: Okay, just most of the time.
Anne: Mmm.
(They hug.)
Polly: Aw. Okay, let's finish this. (Spits and breaks record.)
(all cheering)
Anne: You did it!
(Tuti splits the trophy and distributes it to pay the townspeople before giving the Plantars a small nugget.)
Tuti: Here, extra.
Polly: Wow.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Well, your debt is repaid and my work here is done.
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! Go Polly!
Hop Pop: That's my little spitter.
Sprig: So what are we gonna do with the extra gold?
Anne: I think I have an idea.
Anne: A little to the left. There, that's perfect.
Sprig: (chuckles) Whoo-hoo!
Anne: Well?
Polly: I love it! Hey, sorry, girl time was such a bust.
Anne: Eh, don't worry about it. I mean, the more I think about it, the whole idea of girl time is pretty weird. I mean, who's to say boys don't like spas?
Sprig: (gasps) You went to the spa? Without us?
Hop Pop: Oh, Anne, I love the spa. Did you get that fishy pedicure?
Anne: Yeah, it was amazing.
Hop Pop: Oh, I agree. You know they're actually eating the dead skin off the bottom of your feet?
