(announcer) Welcome to Amphibia's Got Talent!
(cheering)
Hey, shoo! Go away, shoo!
(vocalizing)
Hoo-whee!
I'm thinking, launch him.
Yeah, way ahead of you.
(ground rumbling) (yelps)
(crowd cheering) Heh, heh.
All right, gang. This is ours to lose.
Sprig, you ready?
(coughing) As ready as I'll ever be.
Then get out there and win, win, win!
All right, next up is "Sprig Plantar."
Sprig? Ugh. Performing "Flight of the Moth."
(crowd gasps)
Well, hello there. I know. Right?
(classical, fast tempo)
(crowd exclaims)
(cheering)
It's working. It's working.
Now, Anne, the final touch.
On it.
(crowd cheering)
(crowd gasps)
It's perfection,
everything I could've hoped for.
(bat squeals)
-(crowd gasps) -(both yelp)
(Sprig screaming)
Whoa!
Aah! Sprig!
What do we do? What can we do?
(all scream)
Whoa-ohh-ohh!
(gasps)
Anne, get to that judges' table and wait for my signal.
Pardon me, saving my friend. Love your hair by the way.
Hang on, Polly.
(Sprig screaming)
-Now! -(grunts)
(both screaming)
(gasping, yelping)
(crowd gasps)
(gasping, yelping)
Polly, now's your time to shine.
Sing!
(gasps, inhales)
(inhaling)
- La  -(bat screeches)
 La 
(screaming)
Ah! I got you. I got you.
I got--
-(crowd cheering) -Outstanding!
Grandson? Are you okay?
Oh, I shouldn't have forced you into this.
Because of me and this stupid act,
you were almost digested.
Gah! All I wanted to do was to have... fun
and play my fiddle on stage.
Why'd you have to push me so hard?
Well, I just...
I ran into Wartilda, and she said--
And ascots are--
Vegetables are just not doing well anymore.
And heck, in a couple of years, I don't even know if the stand will be around.
(sighs)
I just wanted to give you a better life
than the one I can give you now.
Hop Pop, my life is perfect the way it is.
And as long as you're in it,
my future will be pretty cool too.
Oh... (sniffling)
-(crying) -(Sprig chuckles)
Absolutely mesmerizing performances.
I'm quaking with emotion.
And how did you ever train that bat?
Or this thing for that matter? Hey.
We hereby declare this family
the winning act of Wartwood's Got Talent.
(crowd cheering)
You simply must come tour with us.
Yes. And share your vision with the rest of the valley.
Thanks, but we like things the way they are.
We don't gotta be stars.
We will keep the trophy. It's gonna help us buy our house back.
(all laughing)
There goes the weirdest family I've ever seen. Absolutely, darling.
(clears throat) Well, Toadie,
I'd say that last act was pretty bad, wouldn't you?
(together) Oh, crud-- (scream)
(crowd cheering)
