(Anne and Sprig are outside, playing baseball with a watermelon gourd.)
Anne: (holds a makeshift scythe like a bat) Hey, batter, batter, batter.
Sprig: (grunting, groans)
(He throws the gourd. Anne swings and misses the gourd, while the scythe flies out of her hands )
Anne: (looking back) Ah, whiffed it. (gasps) Sprig!
Sprig: Huh? (gasps and ducks, the scythe flying over him into the woods. His hat falls apart, showing his orange hair.) Wanna go again?
Anne: Yeah-uh! (surprised) Wait, you have hair? Hey, sorry about your hat. Oh, there it is.
(meowing)
Sprig: (laughing) Hey, you found--
Anne: Shh. Do you hear something?
(meowing)
Anne: (gasps) Something's in trouble.
(panting)
(grunts)
(both gasp)
(The sound is the loud buzzing of giant wasps attempting to sting something stuck in a puddle.)
(grunting)
Anne: Oh, my gosh! We have to save her.
Sprig: Right behind ya.
(panting)
Anne: (grunts, grabs the small creature) Gotcha! (the stingers hit the ground around her) Oop, gotta go.
(grunting)
Sprig: Take that, buzz brains! Go sting someone your own size!
Anne: Let's go!
Sprig: Sprig out! Peace!
(panting)
Anne: You're safe now, little fella. (screams)
Sprig: What's wrong? Are you stung? We'll have to amputate.
Anne: No. This caterpillar looks exactly like my cat Domino from back home.
(meows, purrs)
Anne: I love my cat more than anything in the world. She was irreplaceable. But now I found a replacement. Let's take her home with us!
Sprig: Eh, I don't know, Anne. That's a wild animal. I'm not sure bringing it home is a good idea.
Anne: Pshh. That's ridiculous.
(purring)
Anne: My cat back home was a stray before I adopted her. All it takes is love and patience and... love.
Sprig: You said "love" twice.
(Anne holds the caterpillar near him and it licks him.)
Sprig: Sold!
Anne: It's settled. I hereby dub thee "Domino 2." Come on, girl. Let's go home.
Sprig: Uh, is it broken?
Anne: Hold up. I got an idea. This worked on Domino 1 without fail.
(rattling) (meowing)
Anne: That's a girl. You can do it. Come on.
Sprig: I want it. Give it to me.
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop, old buddy, old pal.
Hop Pop: What do you want, Anne?
Anne: Oh, nothin'. I was just thinking. Doesn't this house feel empty to you?
(Hop Pop turns and looks at the mountain of dishes Anne was supposed to clean.)
Hop Pop: Not especially.
Anne: Wouldn't it be nice to have a sweet, fuzzy, loving critter around?
Hop Pop: A pet?
Anne: Great idea, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: No pets! Every time we get one, Sprig and Polly swear they're gonna take care of it! Like this one spider we had, Charlie Bigbottom. I mean, sure, they were there for all the cuddlin' and the snugglin', but who gets stuck doin' all the work? Good ol' Hop Pop, that's who! I swear to Frog, whoever brings a fuzzy critter into this house will be on dung duty for a month!
Hop Pop: (trailing off) I told Charlie Bigbottom to stay out of the...
Anne: Plan B. We're gonna have to sneak Domino 2 inside.
Sprig: Should we be concerned about this? (lifts his leg, which Domino 2 is nibbling on)
Anne: That is called "play biting." Isn't it cute?
(slurping)
Sprig: Yeah, kinda seems like she's tasting me.
Anne: That's ridiculous. Trust me. I know cats.
Sprig: Well, all right, if you say so. (grunting)
Hop Pop: And how many times did I tell Charlie Bigbottom not to go up the chimney? And that little spider'd look at me with those big green eyes like he understood me. Two minutes later, where do I find him? Up the chimney!
(sneezes) (gasps)
Hop Pop: What's that?
Sprig: Uh, hey, Hop Pop, what's the worst thing Charlie Bigbottom ever did, since we're talking about Charlie Bigbottom?
Hop Pop: Heh! How can I even choose? Jumpin' out in front of Bessie and overturnin' the wagon. Gettin' tarantula hair everywhere. Then there was the time he put a hole in the roof.
Sprig: Where'd that happen again?
Hop Pop: You blind? The big hole right there.
Sprig: I don't see it.
Hop Pop: Right--It's right there!
(Anne chuckles)
(rooster crows)
Sprig: Anne, you awake? Anne? (gasps) Anne! Anne! Anne? Anne? Anne. Anne! Anne!
(snoring)
Sprig: Hey, wake up, wake up!
Anne: Huh? (She turns, and several scratches are shown on her cheek.)
Sprig: What happened? Are you okay?
Anne: Hmm? Yeah, totally. Domino 2 just had a bit of a rough first night indoors.
(yawns)
Sprig: Eesh. Hop Pop is definitely gonna notice something.
Anne: Oh, this is nothing. We just have to keep an eye on her while she's adjusting.
(meowing)
Anne: Isn't that right, Domino 2?
Sprig: Ah...
(chuckles nervously, shouts)
(muffled screaming)
Anne: That's just how she says "I love you." (kisses)
(meowing)
Anne: Aaah!
Hop Pop: (humming) Hmm. Oh, forgot the mustard.
(screams)
Anne: Ugh!
(buzzes weakly)
(meows)
(mouths words)
(hissing)
Anne: Uh...
(meows)
(Anne laughs)
Anne: (laughs) Whoo!
(meowing)
(laughs)
Sprig: Whew! Hope there isn't a Domino 3. (laughs)
(meows)
(purrs)
Anne: It's all worth it when you get to watch your adorable little boo take a nap.
Sprig: I gotta admit, she's pretty darn cute.
Anne: Welcome, brother, to the church of cute.
Sprig: This a cult thing? (stomach growls)
Anne: Whoa. Looks like Domino 2 isn't the only thing purring. Come on. Let's go grab some grub.
Sprig: Ooh, I love grubs.
(sighs)
Anne: Sleep tight, my precious baby angel.
Hop Pop: Whoa, whoa there! Hungry much?
Sprig: (with mouth full) We've been running around all day. We're starving.
Hop Pop: "Runnin' around"? Doin' what?
(gulps) (gulps)
Anne: Oh, nothing.
Sprig: I mean, who can say really?
(crash)
Hop Pop: What was that?
Anne: Mmm, basement ghost?
Hop Pop: Don't be ridiculous. Basement ghosts don't sound anything like that.
(all gasp)
Anne: What the heck is that? Domino 2, where are you? Baby precious!
Hop Pop: Wait. "Baby precious"? That's a pet name, for a pet! You sneak a pet in here?
Sprig: No. (grunts) Okay, we did!
Hop Pop: What'd I tell you about pets?
Sprig: Uh, I'm sorry. It's just that the caterpillar looked just like Anne's pet from back home. It was small, cute. It was black with white spots and it--
Hop Pop: Wait. A black caterpillar with white spots?
Sprig: Yes. Sensing something is wrong.
Hop Pop: That's a Coastal Kill-a-pillar! They're dangerous amphibivores, and they only get white spots right before they're about to--
(Domino 2 shrieks)
(roaring)
(all screaming)
Anne: Domino 2, is that you?
Hop Pop: Shh. These monsters respond to sound. Let's back away slowly and quietly.
Polly: (bangs the door open and yells) Hey, family! What's happening in here?
(roaring)
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Run, kids!
Sprig: I don't wanna die in a basement!
Anne: Domino 2? It's me, Anne. We bonded. I gave you treats. You gave me dead things. Don't you remember?
(purrs, roars)
Anne: Whoa! No, wait! Come back!
(Polly screams)
Hop Pop: Get outta here!
Anne: Guys!
(purring)
(Sprig, Hop Pop, Polly shout)
Polly: I would like to get off the ride now!
Anne: Oh! She's gonna bite their heads off as soon as she's done toying with them.
Anne: Toying with them. Wait a second.
(all grunting) (growling)
(all whimpering)
Anne: Hey, Domino 2! Over here!
(rattling) (yowls)
(meowing)
(screeching)
Anne: Oh, crud.
(panting)
(screeches)
(growls)
Anne: (sighs) Oh, Domino 2, I thought I could change you.
(growls)
Anne: But I guess I was wrong.
(hisses, growls)
Anne: I'm sorry I couldn't make it work. (sighs) It's time to go. (grunts)
(screeches)
Anne: Sayonara, Domino 2.
Hop Pop: And look who's cleaning up after the pet! Hop Pop, that's who!
Anne: (singsongy) Hey.
Sprig: Anne, you're okay!
Polly: Tell me that thing is gone!
Anne: Yeah, it's gone. (sighs) I'm so sorry, you guys. I had no right to put you all in danger, no matter how much I miss my cat. I hope you understand.
Hop Pop: Understand? Understand! I miss Charlie Bigbottom with all my heart and soul!
(bawling)
Hop Pop: Ohhh!
Polly: Uh, can we please fix the giant hole in the house?
Anne: (sighs) Well, just goes to show ya. You can't take some wild animal you found in the woods, have it live in your basement, and think everything's gonna be okay.
Sprig: I don't know. Sometimes it works out.
Anne: Ohhh! You're talking about me, right?
Sprig: Hey, um, made you a little something. I used Domino 2's hair balls as the fur. Here ya go.
Sprig: You hate it, don't ya? It's too ugly, isn't it? You know what, give it back to me--
Anne: I love it!
