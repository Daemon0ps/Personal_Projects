(Open on Earth, where a young Anne is busy swinging.)
Young Anne: Look, Marmar! I'm an eagle!
Young Marcy: Cool! Well, I'm a twin engine cemax amphibious aircraft!
Young Anne and Marcy: (laugh and scream)
Mean Girl #1: Oh, how cute. Now beat it. These swings are ours.
Young Anne and Marcy: (start crying)
Young Sasha: Not so fast, evildoers! Leave those kids alone!
Young Anne and Marcy: Whoa!
Young Sasha: (screams and trips) I'm not done yet. I'll never give up! No matter what!
Young Sasha: (screams and trips)
Mean Girl #2: This is getting weird.
Mean Girl #1: Yeah, we're out of here. Enjoy your swings, babies.
Young Sasha: (laughs) Swings are all yours!
Young Anne: Hey, you wanna swing with us?
Young Sasha: I-I'd like that.
Young Anne: I'm Anne, by the way. This is Marcy.
Young Marcy: Hiya!
Young Sasha: I'm Sasha. Sasha Waybright!
(Flash forward to the present where everyone, joined by Frobo, has arrived at a volcano.)
Anne: And, wha-bam!
The Plantars and Marcy: Whoa!
Anne: The entrance to the third temple.
Sprig: What's it say, Marcy? What's it say?!
Marcy: Well, this can't be right. Lift to enter, "brah?"
The Plantars, Anne, and Marcy: Wow!
Hop Pop: Way to go, Frobo!
Anne: Alright, let's go crush this temple!
The Plantars and Marcy: Yeah!
Hop Pop: Look after Joe Sparrow, Frobo. We'll be back soon.
Anne: Whoo! It's hot in here!
Marcy: All right, gang! There should be three challenges just like the two other temp-les?
The Plantars: (groan and cough)
Anne: Whoa. Are you guys okay?
Hop Pop: Just a little dehydrated from the heat. We'll be alright.
Marcy: Whoa, there boss. Think you're strong to get across?
Anne: I have a distinct feeling that this temple is about strength.
Sprig: Wonder what those are for.
(monster roars)
Anne: Sprig!
Anne: Man, this thing weighs a ton!
Anne, Plantars, and Marcy: (yells)
Marcy: All right, guys. It's hammer time!
Polly: Yeah, this ain't happening.
Anne: I'll defend you guys. Don't sweat it.
Marcy and the Plantars: (scream)
Anne: Guys, no!
Marcy and the Plantars: (screams)
The Plantars: (gasps)
Anne: It can't be.
Marcy: Sash! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe-
Sasha: There's no time! Follow me!
Anne: Sasha.
Sasha: Hey, girlfriend! Good to see you!
Anne: You too?
Marcy: Aah! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha!
Sasha: (laughs) Hey, Marmar! Whoa! Check out your new threads!
Marcy: Speak for yourself, look at that armor! How did you find us?!
Sasha: Simple. We heard you two were traveling together and tracked you both here.
Anne: Did you say we?
Grime: (cackles) Even in this state, those things were no match for me.
Anne and the Plantars: (grumbles)
Sasha: (laughs) Cancel the red alert. Seriously, we're not here to fight.
Sprig: Oh, no?
Sasha: Nope. The whole reason we were stalking you was... so I could tell Anne that everything that happened at Toad Tower was my fault.
Anne: Really?
Sasha: Yup. It was wrong of me to put your frog friends in danger. And doubly wrong of me to push you around.
Anne: Oh. Huh. Wasn't expecting that.
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Forgive me for being skeptical, but why the change of heart?
Grime: After Toad Tower, Sasha and I lost everything.
Sasha: We had to go into hiding and I had a lot of time to think about things. But (chuckles) what are you guys doing in a honkin' volcano?
Marcy: Oh, Sasha. It's crazy! The king of Amphibia told us the music box can transport us back home! But the stones need to be charged at three temples first! This is the third temple!
Sasha: No way! You mean we can almost go home?
Anne: Yup!
Marcy: Each temple has a theme. And this one appears to be strength.
Sasha: Then it's a good thing I showed up.
Sprig: What's that supposed to mean?
Sasha: It means you three are going to slow us down. Go wait outside until we're done.
Anne: Hey! You can't tell them what to do!
Sasha: Okay, fine. It was just a suggestion. Now, come on. Let's move.
Anne: Do you really think she's changed?
Hop Pop: Time will tell, Anne. Time will tell. Say, you got any of that lippy balm? Lips are feeling pretty dry.
Anne: You guys want cantaloupe flavor or bubblegum?
Plantars: Cantaloupe! Cantaloupe!
Hop Pop: Oh, sweet relief!
Anne: You can keep that.
Marcy: Sup, bro'seph. Do you even lift?
Anne: It's not even trying anymore.
Sasha: Ha! This is all me!
Anne: Wait, Sash? Marcy and I have done these temples, and there's always some kind of catch. Let's just search the room before we try that thing.
Sasha: Eh, that'll take too long. Besides, this temple's been pretty direct so far.
Anne: No. Wait, Sasha. I really think we should-
Sasha: (groans)
Anne: Huh.
Sasha: This thing's gonna be over before it starts. Let's get going, nerds.
Grime: By nerds, she means you guys.
Marcy: All right, this should be the final room.
Marcy: You've definitely got skill, no doubt. But it's time you learn what strength is all about.
Sasha: Stay back, everyone. I got this.
Grime: Great grasshopper guts! It's like an elephant tick is standing on my back!
Marcy: That thing has somehow increased the room's gravitational force.
Sprig: I-I can't get up.
Anne: Just sit tight. Us humans will handle this.
Polly: You go, girls.
Marcy: Thanks, Sasha.
Sasha: No problem.
Marcy: The gravity's too much. I can't move.
Sasha: Don't worry. Leave this to us.
Anne: Who would've thought us working together after everything has happened?
Sasha: Yeah, unbelievable. Especially since you still don't trust me. Even after I apologized.
Anne: What?
Anne: What do you mean? I trust you.
Sasha: Oh, please. I've been watching you the whole time. You don't trust me at all.
Anne: Well can you blame me? Oh! Why would I trust you? It wasn't just Toad Tower, Sasha. You've been pushing me around my whole life.
Sasha: I know.
Anne: It feels like my lungs are going to explode.
Sasha: It's over. We can't do this.
Anne: You're right. We can't. But you can. I believe in you.
Sasha: What? How can you believe in me after I was such a jerk to you?
Anne: Because you weren't just a jerk, you also inspired us. You're fierce, you're brave, and most of all, you never give up.
Sasha: You're right! (groans) I'll never give up. Not today, not ever!
Anne, Marcy, Grime and the Plantars: (gasps)
Sprig: How heavy was that armor?
Sasha: (groans) Get croaked!
Marcy: The gravity's back to normal! You did it, Sash!
Anne: Here, go ahead.
Marcy: Congrats, brah. You finally know what it takes to go the distance. For what is true strength without persistence.
Anne: Want to do the honors? I guess that's that. Should we open it?
Marcy: No! No! No! If we turn that thing on, who knows what we'll end up? We should bring it to King Andrias so he can tell us how to use it correctly to get home.
Sasha: Of course! Trust Marcy to already have a plan!
Marcy: Look at this! The gang finally back together again! Now, come on. Let's get back to Wartwood and get these frogs some water.
Polly: Give me that.
Sprig: Finally!
Polly: Take me to my bucket.
Sasha: Thanks for all of that stuff back there. Believing in me and junk.
Anne: Oh, hey. No biggie. I'm sorry for not trusting you earlier. Sasha, do you think maybe we could start over? Do things right this time?
Sasha: I- I'd like that.
Anne: (clears throat) Well, I'm gonna walk away before things get more awkward.
Sasha: (laughs) Not possible.
Grime: You haven't forgotten the plan, have you? We only need these jokers to get safely into Newtopia.
Sasha: Of course, I haven't forgotten. And I'm pretty sure they bought my act back there. Hook, line, and sinker.
Grime: Good. Because the things we've set into motion cannot be stopped.
