Happy Shut-In!
Thank you.
(laughing)
(knocking)
Anne/Polly/Sprig: Stay inside, hide your eyes, give us practical supplies!
Felicia: Oh, you're just in time. I've got one last box of nails. And they're rusty.
Ooh. The good stuff!
(both) Thank you.
Happy Shut-In, kids.
You too, Felicia.
Happy Shut-In!
Right back at ya!
Anne: Ooh. Man, this is a workout. Explain this holiday to me again.
Sprig: It's not a holiday, Anne. It's the annual Blue Moon Shut-In.
Polly: We need the supplies to survive through the night.
Anne: Huh. Well, you know, we have a similar thing in my world called Halloween. We say "Trick or treat," and people give you free candy.
Polly: Free candy! What's the catch?
Anne: If they don't give it to you, you get to play a trick on them.
Polly: (gasps) That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Hop Pop: Hey, kids. What'd y'all get for tonight's Shut-In? Show me the goods.
Polly: I got a hatchet.
Sprig: I got a first-aid kit.
Anne: I got a flamethrower!
(Anne uses said weapon: surprised and jealous, Polly tosses her hatchet on the ground and pouts.)
(screams)
Stumpy: Ooh. Been there.
I need a bath.
You sure this isn't a holiday? You even have jack-o'lanterns.
Those are fear gourds, Anne, and, yes, I'm sure. The Shut-In is dangerous, for tonight the moon turns blue, and anyone who gazes upon it becomes a hideous beast!
And is this true or just a legend? 'Cause sometimes it's hard to get a handle on what's real around here.
No one knows, Anne.
And no one wants to find out!
Ever.
Anne: You guys are really close to my face right now.
Whoa. So when you say "shut-in," you really mean it, huh?
It's actually kinda nice. We sit by the fire--
And tell spooky stories.
And Bessie hides in her shell till morning.
Cool! Let's get this holiday started.
(together) It's not a holiday, Anne.
Fine. Okay.
Would you grab the rest of the decorations from the cart?
It's totally a holiday.
(Hop Pop) I heard that.
(both) Stories! Stories! Stories!
Remember, the stories have to have actually happened and be scary enough to remind us (deep, scary voice) not to go outside! Okay, kids, who wants to go first?
Ooh, ooh! I do!
This is the first year I have one that's really scary. I'm telling the story of "A Night at the Inn." I was traveling with my family on a stormy night. Little did I know, I would soon come face to face with cannibals!
Uh, Polly? We were all there for that.
Oh, right. Hmm. Gimme a minute. I'll come up with another one. Someone else go!
Ooh, I got one. Now, this didn't happen to me, but it did happen to my phone. Get ready for the tale of... "Phone Mo."
Phone what?
"Phone Mo." Like FOMO--- fear of missing out, but with your phone!
(Sprig) I still don't get it.
(Polly) Me neither.
(Hop Pop) Try to make sense, Anne.
(Anne) Just let me tell my story! Anyway, it took place at a school that was like my school, but not my school! And this story wasn't about me. It was about a different girl named, uh... Anna.
(boy) Yo, Anna! What's up?
(grunts)
'Sup, Twig, and...
Molly.
Right.
Hey, check this out, guys.
(chuckles) I'm totally skateboarding-- (screams)
Aw, shucks. (screaming)
(all laughing)
Classic. Hilarious.
(chuckles) Comedy has truly peaked.
'Sup, Haddie? 'Sup, Broadie?
Hey. Have you guys seen the latest trending cute animal video?
Cute animal?
No!
I need this!
Show 'em, Broadie.
Oh, wait. I should probably tell you, people say this video is cursed and everyone who watched it has... mysteriously disappeared. So, ready to watch it?
-(all) Uh...
I don't know, guys. Is it really worth the risk?
(sighs) You may be right, Twig.
Yeah, or... you may be wrong! Show me the video!
(children laughing on video)
(Molly squeals)
Maybe we could watch just a little?
No, Anna. Be strong.
Aw, that's so cute! See?
But look how happy they are.
I said be strong.
Thanks, Twig.
I, for one, am glad we didn't watch that video.
Right? I'm so sick of doing things just because everyone else is.
Feels nice to have autonomy for a change. (bell rings)
Oop! Time for class. Gotta do what the bell says.
(sneakers squeaking)
Autonomy, shunonomy. It's video time, baby!
(tinkly music plays)
(animal squeaks)
Oh!
(children laughing) (fly buzzing)
Man, what even is this little gremlin?
Cutest... video... ever. So worth it.
Wow.
Not a single dislike or negative comment.
Looks like this is the one video on the Internet that everyone loves. Weird.
Ah! Very weird.
 Gonna eat my sandwich Into a square 
 'Cause if I spit Along the edges 
 Then I don't have to share 
And they say I'm not talented.
Haddie, is everything okay?
Broadie's gone missing.
One second he was with me, the next, only his phone was there.
You don't think the curse... Is real?
Pfft. Nah. He's probably just playing a prank on you.
Right, right. It's just a prank.
(buzzing) (both gasp)
Ah! What the...
(tinkly music plays)
(both laugh nervously)
I'm sure it's nothing.
Let me know if you find Broadie.
(phone vibrates)
(tinkly music plays) No! No! Aaah!
(laughs) (bell rings)
(as Gila monster) But, flamingo, we can't elope!
(as flamingo) Shut up and give me some sugar, you Gila monster!
(growling)
And they say I can't write dialogue.
(phone ringing)
What's the sitch, Twig?
I don't know if you've heard, but Broadie, Haddie and Molly have all gone missing!
The video. (gasps) The curse is real.
Sure looks that way. Good thing neither of us watched it, right?
(groans) No, Anna. You didn't.
I'm weak, okay?
Don't panic. Just get rid of your phone and-
(laughter) (Anna gasps)
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Wait a second.
Broadie. Molly. Haddie.
They aren't missing... (gasps)
Hey, help me! I've been trapped in here for 35 years!
(shouts)
(laughing)
I do not like where this is going.
Aaah!
Ah! Stay away from me, you adorable beast!
Take that!
And that! And that!
What the...
(roars)
(screams)
Oh, my gosh.
(as Gila monster) I'll save you, my love. (grunts)
You know, now that I've gotten a closer look at you, you are not cute at all!
(whimpers)
(roars)
Wait a second.
Did that hurt your feelings?
Can't take criticism, huh?
Well, in that case...
Bupadee-bupadee-bop.
Dis... like!
(screams)
Dislike.
And now, for the final touch,
a nasty comment.
Worst video ever.
Into the trash it goes!
(grunts)
(all groaning)
Well, consider me traumatized.
What the heck is this stuff?
Hey, it's boba.
Guys, you're okay.
That's the last time I succumb to any kind of peer pressure.
Well, I should probably go reconnect with my family.
(screams) (cat screeches)
(gasps) Twig!
What is it? What's wrong?
(pants) Guys!
This crazy new burger place just opened
on the haunted side of town.
Everyone's doing it. Come on, let's go!
Yeah! Whoo! Haunted burgers!
(all laughing)
(evil laughter)
(shrieks)
The end.
Not bad. Scary.
(phone beeps) (all gasp)
Oh!
Just a calendar alert reminding me it's Wally's birthday.
(accordion plays)
I'm sure he's fine.
All right, Polly. Back to you.
All right, all right. Here we go.
Once upon a time, an entire town got taken over by zombie mushrooms
in a story I like to call...
"Children of the Spore."
Whoa, hang on. That story's no good either.
We were there. Been there, done that.
That was actually my fault.
(sighs) All right, all right. Someone else go.
Okay, I've got one.
And it's the scariest one yet. It's called...
(in scary voice) "Dead End."
Long ago, when I was just a young frog,
I got my first job as a wagoner.
But never mind that. I had the most beautiful thicket of hair
that Wartwood had ever seen.
It had bounce. It had shine.
It was so thick, when I ran my fingers through it,
my hand would get stuck--
(Anne) Enough about the hair! All right, all right. Geez.
So, one day, I picked up a very strange customer...
Whoa there.
Let's see here. Mr. Littlepot, I presume?
You presume correctly.
Hup! Welcome aboard.
Mighty obliged.
We'll stop at each of these addresses in order, if you please.
And when I ask you to drive on, you do so. Understood?
Can do. Hyah!
Now, for the matter of payment...
Oh, nonsense.
You can pay at the end.
If you're satisfied with your service.
My, oh, my.
An honest businessman?
You are a rare sort, indeed.
So, what kinda business are you in?
Oh, let's just say I'm in the frog business.
(maniacal laugh)
The frog business? Uh, ain't we all.
Okay, stop number one.
Oh, hey. This is Old Man Hopkins' house.
Poor guy's been laid up with red leg for weeks now.
Oh, I'm sure it won't ail him for much longer.
Huh. Probably woulda knocked first, but that's just me.
(crashing)
(humming)
Well, that was fast.
Always is. Onto the next one.
Okay.
(frog woman) Mr. Hopkins! Mr. Hopkins, wake up!
Oh, uh, should we check on him?
I'm sorry, Hopediah, but it's very important we stay on schedule.
 Mama's little tadpole 
 Loves shortbread Shortbread 
(scatting)
(gasps) Is that a slaughter snake?
One bite from that thing could take out a frog in seconds.
We gotta warn that lady!
Huh?
Okay, good idea.
You warn her, and I'll watch the wagon.
(frog woman screaming) Ma'am!
(knocking) Aaah!
Time's a-wasting, Hopediah.
But you-- I heard a scream.
Next stop, if you please.
But that farmer lady.
I am asking you to drive on.
Are you trying to go against our agreement, Hopediah?
Mm.
Boy, uh, we sure are running into a lot of bad luck today, huh?
Why, it almost seems like Death is following us wherever we go.
Following?
Or riding in the back seat.
Aaah!
You! I-- But-- No!
Stay away from me, Frog Reaper!
Hopediah, please don't make a fuss.
I didn't do anything to those frogs.
I'm like you, just taking them where they need to go.
Hmm. Now...
there's only one stop left, then this money is yours.
(sighs) Okay.
Let's see here. Uh...
Next stop is...
(gasps)
No! My house?
Don't take me! Please!
I'm sorry, Hopediah.
Time's up.
(maniacal laughter)
I'm alive?
But then... Wait.
No.
No! My hair! (echoing)
(maniacal laughter)
You've still got it, Littlepot.
(clicks tongue)
You've still got it.
(sniffs, sighs)
And that, children, is how I lost my hair.
Hop Pop, that story was messed up.
Meh, I wasn't that scared.
Oh, you will be.
Okay, Polly. You got your scary story? Yes.
There was a time when frogs lived in fear of a monster
that lurked in the woods.
Scary. Now we're talking.
It had a giant head, spindly legs
and a hideous face bump!
Ooh! Ooh!
Me? Your scary story is me?
Ugh! Way to spoil the ending, Anne.
You're telling me I'm the monster in your story?
Also, your drawing is insulting.
Wah! You people are impossible to please.
Oh, oh! I've got a story.
A few days ago, Ivy and I were playing bugball on the old court in the woods--
Wait. What's your story called?
Huh? Oh, actually I don't kn--
(scary voice) "Skin Deep."
(laughing)
From downtown Bog Bottom.
Rejected! (grunts)
Argh! Don't look, don't look.
(sighs) Sorry, sorry. Just I really hate my hair.
Well, I like your hair.
Thanks, but all the same, I'd rather just cover it up.
Now come on, let's go get our bugball.
Man, that thing went far. We gotta be careful.
We're getting pretty close to the home of...
(in distorted voice) the Seamstress!
The Seamstress?
Yep! Legend says that she's a horrible creature
who sucks the life out of any frog that trespasses on her property,
then steals their skin to wear as clothes.
What? Why?
Nobody knows.
Ah, but that's just an old fly's tale.
(chuckles) Yeah. (nervous chuckle)
Whoa. Look at that.
Oops. Broke a window.
Better hope whoever lives here isn't the Seamstress! (chuckles)
Kidding. Come on, let's check it out. (whimpers)
(owl hoots)
Well, no one's home. We should probably just leave.
Come on, this place looks deserted.
Let's just run in and get the ball.
No one'll even know we were here.
(grunts)
I think someone's gonna know.
Ah, I'll fix it. Just find the ball.
Spooky! Nice.
Uh-huh. Now where could it be?
Ivy, look!
Sprig. Yes, you're right. These are very common.
I'll keep looking!
Found it. (gasps)
(sighs) Glad that's over wi--
Oh, my gosh.
Frog skins!
(grunts) (screams)
Sorry. We're so sorry. We're leaving. Ah! Hello. Sorry.
Fresh... skins.
(both scream) The Seamstress!
Sprig. We can't get away. We're gonna have to fight it.
Come on! But it's gross, and I don't wanna.
(grunting)
(screams, grunts)
Ivy! (shouts)
(Seamstress grunts)
(grunts) Huh?
Don't look. Don't look at me!
(gasps) She's a glass frog.
I've heard of this species.
They're born with translucent bodies.
(gasps) Sprig!
I know why she steals other frogs' skins.
What? Why? I don't follow.
Because she's not comfortable in her own skin.
Huh?
Aw.
Sprig, now!
(Ivy grunts) (Seamstress groans)
Let's burn this baby to the ground.
(grunts, screams)
(groans)
(roars)
(both laughing)
You look good without the hat. I mean it.
Aw, shut up, you. (giggles)
(both laughing)
And we never saw her again. The end.
What? That's the end?
I have so many questions. Didn't Ivy get bitten?
Is that thing still in the woods?
Hop Pop: Did any of those frog skins look like my friend Gabe? I haven't seen him in a while.
Sprig: Guys, seriously, everything's fine.
(knocking)
Who could that be? At this time of night? During the Shut-In?
I'll get it. (all) Sprig, no!
Ivy?
(all screaming)
(laughing) Huh?
We got you good.
And that is how you tell a scary story.
Yeah, seriously. That was good. Nice.
Yes, that was something we all enjoyed.
Ivy, that mask, it's not...
Nah, it's just burlap. Made it myself.
Well, that was fun, but I better get home.
Okay, just be careful out there.
And don't look at the moon.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I can't see a thing with this on. (chuckles)
Ooh! Sorry, sir. (chuckles)
Well, we better board this up. Wait, where's Polly?
That's weird. She was just here a second ago.
What if she slipped out while the door was open and ran off to look at the Blue Moon?
Hop Pop, you're overreacting.
"Dear Fam, I slipped out while the door was open
and ran off to go look at the Blue Moon."
What? Why would she do that?
"So that I can get my own scary story to tell.
Love, Polly."
Oh, that makes sense. Oh, crud.
We have to find her before she looks at the moon
and transforms into a hideous beast!
Polly! Where are you?
Kids! Get under the umbrella.
There she is. I see her.
Polly, no! Don't look!
(maniacal laughter)
Oh, no, the blue moon has possessed her!
(distorted maniacal laughter)
Nope. Not even a little.
Oh! What does this mean?
The legend must be false.
What a bummer. Now I have no scary story to tell.
Trust me, Polly.
Thinking a blue moon had actually got you
was way scarier than any of our stories tonight.
Really?
I had chills, dude.
A monster sister would be a nightmare!
My hair turned white. Oh, wait.
Aw, thanks, you guys.
All right, gang. Let's turn in.
(grunts, groans)
(grunting)
Huh? (grunting)
(howls)
What the...
Hmm. Works for me.
Hey, guys, guess what. The legend's true.
(all scream)
(Hop Pop) Nightmares are real!
(Sprig) Not a holiday. (Anne) Definitely not a holiday.
No! (all laughing maniacally)
