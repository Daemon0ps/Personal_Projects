(In the resistance's base, Mrs. Croaker, Wally, Loggle, Maddie, and Toadie have gathered to meet with Anne and Sasha for a mission debriefing. Toadie is the only one who isn't wearing new edgy clothing.)
Sasha: Listen up, soldiers. The Marauders have intercepted our latest shipment of weapons.
- (booing) - How could they?
Anne: Sorry. (Chuckles) Marauders?
Sasha: A gang of dirty, anarchist frogs who don't work for Andrias or the rebellion. They hijack caravans, raid villages for scraps and are basically a huge, unwashed thorn in my side.
Can't we just smack 'em down?
There are too many of 'em to take head-on.
Sasha: Bingo.
Anne: Whoa.
Sasha: So, we're gonna sneak into their camp and steal our stuff back.
- Diabolical. - Thieving from the thieves?
Wally: I love dramatic irony!
Sasha: Croaker, you and your team come up with the battle strategy. Me and Anne are gonna go grab the gear.
(chirps)
Mrs. Croaker: All right, you miserable layabouts, listen up.
Toadie: (clears throat) Uh, hey. (Record scratches) Before we start, does anyone want a Post-it note? Can't have a good meeting without Post-it notes.
Mrs. Croaker: (sighs) Okay, here's the plan. Loggle and Maddie, you're with me. Wally and Toadie, you're on offense. We keep the pressure on until Anne and Sasha are out with the goods. Now gear up. We leave in three!
Toadie: Um, Mrs. Croaker? (feet screech) As much as I'd like to be on offense with Walliam, I'd be much more comfortable as the...
Mrs. Croaker: Lookout! Again? Toadie, this is our team's sixth mission, and all you ever wanna do is organize the meetings and be the lookout!
Wally: (chuckles) It's what I'm good at! Direct physical confrontation, not so much. (screams) Oh, my gosh! I blew up Maddie!
Maddie: You wish. Sup?
Toadie: (screams)
Mrs. Croaker: Listen, Toadie. The world has changed, and we've had to change with it.
(grunting)
(whistling)
Mrs. Croaker: Don't you wanna step out of your comfort zone, become something more than the vest-wearing pencil pusher you've always been?
Toadie: But my comfort zone is so comfy.
Mrs. Croaker: Well, I think you're capable of so much more.
Toadie: Nope! Back to the comfort zone!
Huh?
(wind whistling)
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
Who cares? Let's get our stuff and go.
- (cackles) - (shouts)
(Marauder) We got you.
They fell for it. Get 'em!
Shoot! Head for the rendezvous!
(both grunt)
(clamoring)
(grunting)
Whew!
That was clo... Oh, no!
Where's everybody else?
(marauders chuckling)
Anne: The others got caught! We gotta get back down there.
Sasha: Absolutely not.
Anne: What? Why not?
Sasha: We might just get captured ourselves, and the resistance can't lose both its leaders.
Anne: Then what do we do?
Sasha: Just wait. Croaker's team is pretty tough. There's a chance they'll escape on their own.
Anne: (sighs) Fine. What should we do till then?
Sasha: We'll train.
(Back at the Marauders' camp, Mrs. Croaker's team is locked in a cage, with the Marauders cackling. The leader walks up to them.)
Leader: Well, well, what do we have... (removes his helmet, revealing himself to be Barry) here?
Mrs. Croaker: Barry? The candy man? You run the Marauders?
Barry: Dang right, I do. Turns out I've got a sweet tooth for anarchy.
What are you gonna do with us, you sicko?
Barry: We're going to sell you sugarplums to Andrias' army. They pay extra for resistance frogs.
- (all gasp) - You help Andrias?
What are you, insane?
Barry: Look around you, toots. The whole world is insane, but that suits us, don't it, Brian?
Brian: I used to be a tax accountant. Now I drink the blood of my enemies and eat dessert for breakfast.
Barry: See? Turns out the end of the world is sweet! (Cackles)
(all cackling)
Toadie: Well, nothing left to do but accept our fate. Anyone want a Post-it note for their will?
Loggle: (sobbing) No! I'm too beautiful to die!
Get it together! Here's the plan:
I'll get a guard's attention and take him out.
Maddie, unlock the cell.
To a die and I will take the Marauders on the ground
while you all get the stolen weapons.
Then Wally blasts us an exit.
- Got it? - (all) Got it!
Uh, Mrs. C.?
(shouts) Fine! Toadie, you're the lookout!
Now let's do this.
Excuse me, youngster.
I'm a little confused. Where am I?
Back off the bars, lady. You're in Marauder jail.
Now, if I've been helpful to you, can you please
fill out this comment card?
(growls)
(shouts) G-G-Guys. Incoming. Incoming.
Uh, come on, Toadie. You can do this.
Excuse me, sir,
but I am going to ask you kindly
to please stop what you are doing.
Hey, that wasn't so har...
Shut up, tadpole.
(To a die screams)
(grunts)
Oh, that's not good.
Anne: (groans) Haven't we waited long enough? We've gotta get down there.
Sasha: (chuckles) Come on, Anne. It hasn't even been 30 minutes. Give it a little more time.
Anne: Easy for you to say.
Sasha: What do you mean by that?
Anne: I-It's nothing. On your left.
(all cackling)
(sighs) I knew I should have stayed in the old comfort zone.
Instead, I made things worse.
Oh, man. She's out cold.
We need a plan, and we need it now. So what do we do?
I could craft dolls to curse the Marauders
in a few hours or days.
What if we just did a bunch of push-ups to get the brain juices flowing?
I've got it. Just get me to the boomshrooms.
- And then? - That's it. Just get me
to the boomshrooms.
What were we talking about again?
I just need a strand of their hair!
I knew I should have brought me own boomshrooms!
- I've got a barrel of them. - Or a toenail.
- Um, guys. - Only one speaker at a time.
You can't be productive, if you're not organized!
Guys. Guys!
Aw. Look who it is. The tadpole.
You having a good time?
Ooh, what do we have here?
(cackles)
No!
(cackles) And thanks for the souvenir.
That is it!
(roars)
Croaker was right!
It's time for a change.
Time for me to be uncomfortable!
(growls)
Oh, not again.
(Wally, Loggle) Wow. He's possessed.
Forget organized and productive meetings,
we just need to get it together.
Loggle, let's put those muscles to good use.
Start digging!
Maddie, you navigate us to the stolen weapons.
Wally, when we get there, you will use a few boomshrooms
to cause a distraction so we can get away!
What about you?
Me? I'm the lookout.
As in look out for my fist!
I'll be the guy who makes sure this all goes according to plan. Got it?
(all) Yes, sir!
Enough with the slapping!
(growls)
Ach, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going.
(whispering)
(laughs)
(shouts)
Sasha: Look, Anne, I'm telling you, we just have to wait.
Anne: Wait? My friends are in trouble, and here we are sparring.
Sasha: That's because we can't risk...
Anne: Getting captured. I know. I get it. And I know they're just soldiers to you, but to me they're everything.
Sasha: Anne, it isn't like that.
Anne: What was that?
Sasha: That's our cue. Come on. It's go time.
- (Marauder screams) - (Loggle shouts)
- Huh? - What the...
When you're in a meeting,
bring some pens and notepad!
(screams, grunts)
(grunts)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
(chuckles)
Oh, gumdrops! Not again!
Get back here, tadpole!
(groans)
I'll be taking this back.
Whoa! Toadie! Where'd you get those moves?
It's actually how I dress the mayor every morning.
Let's go!
Boink! (beeps)
(screaming)
Wow, Toadie. Great work out there.
Savage stuff.
Thanks, commander.
Huh. Impressive, Toadie.
I always knew you had it in you.
Not me. You kidding?
I'm still in shock.
Anne: Wow. You were right. Looks like they could
handle themselves. Hey, uh, about what I said back there...
Sasha: It's okay, but believe me, I do care about these frogs. A lot. We've been through some serious stuff together when you were gone.
(all laughing)
Sasha: But being in charge means making tough calls. And sometimes you have to stop and remember to have faith in the people around you. You taught me that.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
(all groaning)
Aw, man. They took all our stuff. Even our food!
(groans) This couldn't possibly get any worse.
What are we gonna eat now?
Mmm. (chuckles)
Barry: Holy... (crows)
