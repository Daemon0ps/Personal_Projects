(rooster crows)
Mayor Toadstool: (inhales) Ah... Just breathe in that country air, Toadie. I can't believe I'm saying it, but this town's kinda growing on me.
Toadie: Okay, sir. Item one, there are some potholes that need filling, but the money we have left is supposed to buy us that (whispering) swanky new Jacuzzi.
Toadstool: Hmm... You know what, Toadie? You go ahead and fill those holes.
Toadie: Who are you, and what have you done with my beautiful Mayor?
Toadstool: Get a hold of yourself, Toadie. Since we saved a couple of lives at Toad Tower, people have been seeing me a little differently. And, well, frog dang it, it's rubbing off on me.
(man grunts)
There we go.
(grunts)
Toadie, grab the other side.
(grunting)
(sighs) Thanks, Mayor.
- Good ol' Mayor. - We didn't vote for him, but he turned out okay.
(growls)
What?
Jacinda: Mayor Toadstool I presume? I am Jacinda, official emissary of Newtopia. We have come to discuss... the events of Toad Tower.
Why, sure. I may have been to Toad Tower that day. But I had nothing to do-
-Enough prattle. Let's get right to... the point.
(fanfare)
Jacinda: By order of Newtopia, I hereby decree that Mayor Froderick Toadstool has been appointed the new Head Toad of Toad Tower.
- (noisemakers whistle) - (both gasp)
Jacinda: With Captain Grime gone, we need someone we can trust. And from what we've heard, you're the toad for the job.
(choir singing)
(gasps) Frog in heaven.
Jacinda: Right... A lot of money. Even had to dodge some bandits to get it here safe and sound. (chuckles) Anyway, this money is for rebuilding Toad Tower. But who's to say that's all it's for, hmm? (chuckles) So pack your bags. We leave at sundown.
Mayor Toadstool: Wait, leave? As in leave Wartwood?
Jacinda: Uh, yeah. You didn't think we were gonna build the tower here, did you?
Mayor Toadstool: (chuckles) Yeah, hypothetically, what would happen if I refused?
Jacinda: You'd find yourself rotting in one of (voice lowers) the deepest, dankest dungeons in all of Amphibia. (normal voice) Hypothetically.
Toadie: He accepts. He accepts!
Jacinda: Great. The job is yours. Pending an evaluation. Toodles.
Sir! What in frog's name are you doing?
A gig like this is all you've wanted.
Look at our vision board.
Look at it!
I know. I know it's crazy,
but wouldn't you miss this place?
We are not having this conversation.
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go pack all 800 pairs of your silk pajamas.
(townspeople chattering)
- (slams) Anne: Yo, Toadstool! Hop Pop sent me to ask about these parking tickets. (Grunts as she lugs in a chest filled to the brim with tickets.) He says he wasn't even in town on these days.
Boonchuy, did you ever work your entire life to fulfill a dream, but when it finally comes true, you realize that maybe it wasn't your dream?
Uh... we still talking about parking tickets?
I've just been appointed the Head Toad of Toad Tower. All I have to do is leave this crummy town and never look back. It's everything I've ever wanted! So why do I feel so down?
Maybe you've come to love this crummy town more than you thought you would. I certainly relate.
I just wish there was a way out of this.
Well, back home, whenever Mom asked me to do chores, I'd do a really bad job so she wouldn't ask me anymore.
That's it! I've just gotta convince them I'm the wrong toad for the job. You gotta help me. No one's more incompetent than you.
Not happening.
You leave me no choice. Prepare yourself for the cutest thing you've ever seen. (Whimpers and puts on puppy dog eyes.)
Anne: (reacts in disgust) Okay, okay, I'll help. Just never make that face again. First, we're gonna need some backup.
Lead the way, kid.
All right. I've come up with two ways that this can go. Number one, make the Mayor look like a coward. Number two, make him look incompetent.
Is there a third option?
No. Any questions?
- Kind of. - Several.
What's the sitch with the parking tickets?
Polly: Hey, shouldn't we get Marcy and Frobo in on this?
Anne: No can do. Marcy said she wanted to spend the day studying Frobo. Wonder how that's going.
(Cut to a small shack where a charging sound is heard from within. Suddenly, an explosion occurs inside as smoke begins to emerge.)
Marcy: (coughing) Fascinating.
Anne: Don't worry. We can do this.
All it takes is teamwork and coordination.
(cheers)
(all grunt)
This is our farmer's market.
It ain't much, but it's our pride and joy.
Give me all your coppers, old frog.
And make it snappy.
Mayor Toadstool, help.
No can do, random farmer,
for I am but a lowly coward.
I guess I'll just hand over all my hard-earned coppers.
(grunts)
Anne and Sprig?
Why in tarnation are you robbing your own stand?
I can explain. No need. I get it.
You distracted the robbers long enough for the muscle to show up.
You're truly Head Toad material.
Well, that didn't work.
Don't worry. We still got the second option.
No talking.
And here's the fence I had built
to keep those burrowing moles
from getting into Wartwood.
- Fence? But they burrow, right? - What's your point?
Come on, kids. Herd those moles.
I'm just saying a fence might not keep them out.
And I'm say... (screams) (growls)
(screams)
(screams) I really thought that bad idea would work.
(shouts, grunts)
Incredible. What a show of strength.
Truly, we've made the right choice. (chuckles)
- (whispering) - Any other ideas? - Nope.
- We're sunk. - Well, then it looks like I have no choice.
I better finish packing. (grunts)
No need, sir.
We're all packed and ready to go.
You've got a competent assistant here, Mayor.
-Too bad he's about to be out of a job, -Excuse me.
Did you think you were going to be assistant to the Head Toad?
(chuckles) Adorable. But no.
I, Jacinda, will be Toadstool's deputy at Toad Tower.
(screams)
(gasps) Toadie? Now see here.
I've got something to say to you, and I don't care if I go to prison for it.
Oh. I'm all ears.
(gulps) Truth is...
The truth is...
- (bugle sounds) - (shouting)
Where do you think you're going?
What could it mean?
(chuckle)
Fens? And uh, uh... the creepy one.
- Mire. - Right. Him.
Oh, no. That means...
(grunts)
Greetings, Wartwood. You miss me?
Oh, man. You stink. (groans)
Whose fault is that?
Since the tower fell, we've had to live as bandits.
What do you want, Bog?
Nothing much.
Just everything valuable you frogs got.
And if we refuse?
Then we'll have ourselves a little cookout,
burn this whole place to the ground.
(gasps)
So, what'll it be, Mayor?
(sighs)
Look after Toadie for me.
Time for me to do what I do best...
lie to a fairly large group of people.
Look at you, Bog.
I'm surprised you ain't thinking bigger.
What do you mean?
I mean,
how'd you like to be my second-in-command
at the newly rebuilt Toad Town?
What's he talking about? (murmurs)
Mayor Toadstool's leaving us?
Huh. But I heard you liked being Mayor now.
Me, like being Mayor of a disgusting, Podunk, mudhole town like this?
Ha. Not a chance.
Well, we are tired of living in caves and eating scraps.
Then you're gonna love this next bit.
(grunts)
Join me and half of this is yours.
It's beautiful.
Oh, I agree. Why not take a closer look?
(groans) Attack!
Get 'em, boys.
(grunting)
(screams)
Where'd you go?
Whoops. Sorry, Mire.
(screaming)
(grunts)
Go get him, Archie.
(cheers)
(clears throat) I know. It's time to go to Toad Tower.
Just give me a minute to say goodbye.
All this time, I thought you were the right toad for this job.
But it looks like I was wrong.
-Huh? -You're soft, Toadstool. Way too soft.
You love this town, and any moron can see it.
I'm afraid we need someone cutthroat, someone ruthless.
Someone just like him.
- Huh? - (gasps)
Uh, you pointing at the right guy?
You were seconds away from burning this town
if you didn't get what you wanted.
We could use that kind of resolve
that kind of backbone, that kind of ambition.
So, how 'bout it, Bog?
Wanna rule this valley together?
When do we start?
Sorry, Froderick, but a heart is the one thing
the Head of Toad Tower can't have.
See you around, Wartwood.
I'm gonna make Grime seem like a big softy.
(chuckles maniacally)
Well, that went well.
Who am I kidding? This is terrible!
Everyone, about what I said back there...
Ah, shove off, you big galoot.
We knew you were just looking out for the town.
You may be a corrupt, no-good, money-grabbing louse...
But you're our money-grabbing louse.
(sniffs)
I don't know what to say.
(gasps, grunts)
Don't leave me!
I won't, Toadie.
I won't. (sighs)
Who's that snuggly little baby? (sighs)
Who is that? Who is that?
(coos)
Anne: Uh, should we be watching this?
