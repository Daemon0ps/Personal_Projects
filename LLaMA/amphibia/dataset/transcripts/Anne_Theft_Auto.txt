(Anne and the Plantars are riding on Bessie.)
Hop Pop: Ah, a leisurely outing with Bessie. Why, we could really go anywhere. Do anything.
Sprig: Ooh, ooh! Can we get Swamp Slushies? They have new flavors.
Hop Pop: (laughs) Nope.
Polly: Can we go off-road? (She pulls Hop Pop's eyelids.) Do some crazy stunts?
Hop Pop: Double no.
Anne: Ooh, ooh! Can I drive?
Hop Pop: Sure.
Anne: Aw, come on, Hop Pop- Wait, really?
Hop Pop: Absolutely. I've been trying to teach this guy for years. (He points to Sprig.)
Sprig: It's true.
Anne: All right! Give me those reins. I'm ready to drive. (At the Plantar Farm, Hop Pop drops a big book on a tree stump.)
Hop Pop: Not before reading this, you ain't.
Anne: What?
Hop Pop: This is Bessie's History. Before touching a snail's reins, you gotta know them. Feel their heartbeat next to yours and become one.
Anne: Hop Pop, it's just a vehicle. We had a family car back home. It's no biggie. (Hop Pop throws the book at her.) Oof!
Hop Pop: Don't care. You can't drive Bessie, unless you read this cover to cover. And that's final.
Anne: Are there pictures?
Hop Pop: There are diagrams.
Anne: Noooooooo!
Hop Pop: Sheesh. Dramatic much? Now if you'll excuse me, Polly's due for a wash. (He picks up a dirty Polly from a mud puddle.)
Polly: No, no. Wait. No! I'll just get dirty again. You can't stop me! I learned this from watching you, Anne!
Anne: Ugh. I'll be old before I finish reading this thing.
Sprig: Yeah, page five is as far as I got. Too much description, not enough plot.
Anne: (sighs) This is ridiculous. I don't need history. (She puts the book in Bessie's bag and jumps onto her.) I need experience. Hey. What do you say we take a harmless test-drive? Prove to Hop Pop we're fast learners? (Sprig starts to take her hand, but stops.)
Sprig: Hmm. Do you get the feeling this is one of those decisions we'll look back on and say, "Ooh-boy, we probably shouldn't have done that"?
Anne:  We'll get Swamp Slushies while we're out. 
Sprig: (Jumping onto Bessie) No regrets!
Anne: That's what I like to hear. Hyah! (Bessie starts to move fast as Anne and Sprig whoop with joy. Mrs. Croaker is then seen riding her ladybug.)
Mrs. Croaker: Huh? What in tarnation? (She sees dust coming her way. Bessie rides past her very fast, causing her ladybug to spin out of control.) Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sprig: (Patting his bottom) Out of the way, slowpoke!
Mrs. Croaker: Hooligans! Ruffians! Swamp suckers!
Anne: Whoa. What was that?
Sprig: I've always wanted to try road rage.
Anne: And the verdict?
Sprig: Exhilarating.
Anne: Live your truth! Yeah!
(both laugh)
Sprig: Man, you were right. We didn't need to read some silly book. You drive just fine.
Anne: Just fine? Pshh. Boy, I'm a natural. (gasps) Ooh, ooh! Wanna take this baby off-road?
Sprig: Yup.
(revving)
Sprig: Whoo-hoo!
Both: Whoa!
(laughing)
Both: Whoa!
(laughing)
Both: Whoa! Oof!
Anne: (sighs) So, off-roading. Fun. But how about we go back to on-roading?
Sprig: Good old reliable on-roading, yes, please.
Anne: All right, Bessie. Let's move. (She whips Bessie, but she doesn't move.) One more time. Let's move. (Bessie still doesn't move.) Um, Bessie?
(sputtering)
Sprig: You all right, girl?
Anne: Hey, what's going on here? Does it need fuel in the tank or something? Is the oil low? Come get the tasty fuel, Bessie.
Sprig: Ew, Anne. These leaves are tastier. Here, Bessie. I got dem good leaves, girl.
(purrs)
Anne: Hmm. Maybe we can push her? Give her a jump-start? I'm sure that's a thing.
(both straining)
Anne: Okay. She is way too heavy.
Sprig: (panting)
Anne: Also, I'm crazy out of shape.
Sprig: What are we gonna do? We're stuck.
Anne: We have no choice. I'll stay here with Bessie while you hitch a ride back to the farm and... (groans) ... go get Hop Pop.
Sprig: Good idea. It's the right thing to do, even if we get an earful. Back in a flash (He uses his tongue to grab a tree branch and jumps from tree to tree.)
(sighs)
(scatting)
(yawns)
Anne: Ah, this is so boring. (groans) Wish I had something to read.
Anne: Fine. But just to pass the time. (coughs) Okay, let's see here. "It was an especially cold morning the day Bessie was brought into this world."
Hop Pop: (narrating) "The leaves had just changed color, and now I shall describe those leaves to you in great detail--" (Anne slams the book shut.)
Anne: Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
(grunting)
Sprig: Aha!
Sprig: Over here, over here. I need a ride.
(coughing)
(tires squeal)
Sprig: Oh, thank you so much for stopping. I, uh--
Sprig: Oh.
Mrs. Croaker: Bless my socks. If it isn't Sprig Plantar.
(barks)
Sprig: (chuckles) Yep. Hey, uh, sorry about earlier. Got a little carried away.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, pishposh. Sadie Croaker never holds a grudge, honey.
Sprig: Well, that's lucky. Will you give me a lift back home? It's urgent.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, absolutely.
Sprig: Thanks, Mrs. Croaker.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, my pleasure, honey. Well, go on and get comfy. Watch out for ol' Archie, though. His venom can cause paralysis. Now hold on to your eyebrows. 'Cause here we go! (She whips her ladybug and whoops with joy.)
Sprig: Whoo! (The ladybug moves very slowly.) Can't this thing go any faster?!
Hop Pop: (narrating) "And it was at that moment I realized Bessie was no ordinary snail, but a kind, clear soul who would help others at a drop of a hat. I raised my bid to 400 copper pieces, winning the auction, and in the process, saving Bessie from the nefarious Jim Snapes."
Anne: Yes! In your face, Snapes. (grunts) Man. This is actually pretty good. (She takes some leaves and chews on them.) And I need to stop eating leaves. (Meanwhile, Sprig is holding Archie while humming.)
Sprig: Come on, come on.
Mrs. Croaker: You know what would make this ride go a lot quicker?
Sprig: What? Anything. What?
Mrs. Croaker: A song! (vocalizing)  Ninety-nine jugs Of juice on the wall   Ninety-nine jugs of juice   Take one down, pass it around  (Back with Anne, she is still reading Bessie's History.)
Hop Pop: (narrating) "The snow swirled around us and I knew we were doomed. I could feel the strength leaving my body bit by bit. The sweet embrace of eternity crept closer and closer. Until suddenly I heard a sound pulling me back." (warbling) "Bessie... Bessie was singing!" (Anne starts sobbing.)
Anne: You go, girl. (She hugs Bessie's shell and her tears run down it.) You noble, noble creature. Man. This is messing me up. (sniffles) Now let's see. Where was I? (reading) "The reason Bessie had hidden in her shell was now very clear to me. A predator was close. And not just any predator. A natural enemy of snails."
(rustling)
(bird caws)
Anne: Uh... Hello? Uh, anything in here about this predator? Oh, there we go. Aw, it's actually pretty cute.
(snarling)
(screams)
(whimpers)
(snarling)
(yells)
(growling)
Anne: Cone on, come on. Yes!
Anne: (reading) "When Bessie senses danger, you gotta sit on her shell and yell at the top of your lungs, 'Bessie, things are getting messy!'"
Anne: Yes! Whoo!
(growling)
Anne: Eat our dust, hedgehogs.
(screams)
Anne reading: "If you still haven't escaped, give Bessie some berries from the secret compartment in the front of her shell."
Anne: Whoa, this is gross. Let's do this thing, Bessie.
(purrs)
(yelping)
Anne: Way to go, Bessie! You are the queen of the road.
(purrs)
Anne: All right, let's go home. (Bessie starts moving again. Back on Mrs. Croaker's ladybug, Sprig is lying down, fed up with the song she is singing.)
Mrs. Croaker:  Take one down Pass it around   No more jugs of juice On the wall 
Sprig: (sighs) Glad that's finally over.
Mrs. Croaker: One more time! (Sprig covers his face with Archie and screams.)
Anne: Hey, kid, need a lift?
(purrs)
Sprig: Anne! Thank goodness. Okay, bye, Mrs. Croaker. Thank you.
Mrs. Croaker: Bye, darlin'. Next time, try to keep that road rage in check. (laughs) Yee-haw! (She whips her ladybug and it takes off at high speed. Mrs. Croaker's cackling is heard.) Woo-hoo!
Sprig: Pretty sure I just got played.
Anne: That woman is everything I want to be. (It is dark when she and Spring return to the farm.)
Sprig: We made it. And it looks like Hop Pop's still washing Polly. (Polly, still dirty, is bouncing around the house.)
Polly: You'll never take me alive!
Hop Pop: Dang it, Polly. You're getting filth everywhere! (A crash is heard.)
Sprig: Hey. You coming?
Anne: I think I'm going to spend a little more time with ol' Bessie here.
Sprig: Suit yourself.
(door closes)
(purring gently)
Anne: Now where were we?
(snoring)
Hop Pop: (grunts) What the hey?
Anne: Good morning, Hopadiah.
Hop Pop: Anne?
Anne: I did it. I read the whole thing. In one night.
Hop Pop: Impressive. Kinda scary. But impressive.
Anne: I was wrong about Bessie. She's not just a vehicle. She's a noble, beautiful creature.
Hop Pop: And now that you've read this, all you need is experience.
(chuckling)
(evil laughter)
Hop Pop: I don't feel safe.
