(The episode begins with Wartwood in a state of disrepair then the screen moves down to show all of its citizens living in an underground community.)
Toadie: (Carrying a bag of coins) Aren't these worthless, sir?
Mayor Toadstool: That don't mean we don't have to count them, Toadie.
(whirring)
(groans)
Maddie and Polly: (both laughing) (barks)
Sprig: Oooh. A corpse-maker moth. (clears throat) You're supposed to kiss when you see one, otherwise your crops will be cursed for seven years. (pecks Ivy's cheek) Just to be safe.
Ivy: (chuckles) Crops are very important.
(shrieks)
(grunting)
Sprig: Whoa! Nice shot.
(bell tolling)
Sprig: Oop. sound like the mission briefing bell.
Ivy: Come on! (sees the seats are full and groans) There's no seats left together.
Sprig: Attention, fellow freedom fighters. Will someone give up their seat for Sprivy, Wartwood's cutest couple?
(giggles)
Loggle: Not this again.
Mrs. Croaker: (scoffs) Young love is the worst.
Ivy: No takers, hey? Hmm. Guess we'll just stand in the back together.
Sprig: As long as we're together.
(all groaning, murmuring)
Sasha: Good morning, everyone. Wait. Is it morning? It's hard to tell underground. Whatever. We've got good news and bad news.
Grime: Good news is we've secured a major shipment of crucial supplies from a wealthy pro-Wartwood elite.
(all cheering)
Anne: But the bad news is the only way to Wartwood is through the mountain pass, and Andrias has it locked down, guarded by a giant laser cannon.
Laser cannon stinks.
Wally: I like the other news better!
Anne: Why does Grime always get to do the good news?
Sasha: The cannon is protected by a force field. If we can take that out, we can destroy the weapon. There's a robot battalion protecting both structures. But every hour, there's a five-minute window where the robots change shifts. That's our chance to strike.
Loggle: Wait. The robots change shifts?
Mrs. Croaker: Everyone deserves a break, Loggle.
Sasha: I'm bringing two teams of two. One for the shield generator, one to take out the cannon before the five minutes are up. Stumpy, Fern, Ivy, and Sprig, follow me.
Stumpy: Looks like our number's up.
Sprig: Ha! Of course they want the two of us.
Ivy: Yeah, after all, we're perfectly in sync.
(both laugh)
Anne: All right. Well, that's the only mission today, so what do you guys wanna do?
Wally: Can we have a pinata party?
(Anne and Grime glance at each other surprised.)
Grime: Don't see why not.
(As if on cue, a pinata of Andrias falls from the ceiling as mariachi music plays. Everyone cheers and start wailing on the pinata with sticks.)
Sasha: Okay, so the teams are, Sprig with Stumpy, and Ivy with Fern.
(both gasp)
Sprig: Uh... (chuckles)... Sasha, shouldn't me and Ivy be partners?
Ivy: He means 'cause we're dating.
Sasha: (sighs) Listen, twerp and twerpette, you're not here to pass notes and play footsie. You're here to do a job. And these pairings are super important to the mission.
Sprig: (sobbing) What will I do without you?
Ivy: I'll miss you every second.
Sasha: (rolls her eyes) Good Lord!
(chitters)
Stumpy: This one is for bashing and smashing.
Uh...
Stumpy: This one is for slicing and dicing.
Fern: Wow. I wish my hands were scissors. Working at the salon would be a breeze.
Stumpy: Aye, lass, but then you'd never be able to caress a wee baby tadpole. Or hold hands with the love of your live!
Fern: Seems worth it to me!
I can't believe we have to split up.
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to anyone.
There's gotta be a way to switch, as long as Sasha doesn't find out.
(bird shrieking)
Sasha: All right, there's our target. And our supplier is just on the other side of the pass. I'll keep watch up here, and signal him when the cannon is down.
(grunting)
Sasha: Sorry, cheerleading muscle memory. Here's a watch for each of you. The shift change is about to start. Follow my plan exactly and it should just be enough. Okay, team, move out!
(all grunting)
Mail Frog:  Delivery for Wartwood Delivery today 
Mail Frog:  Delivery for Wartwood Delivery delayed 
Geez.
Oh! Hey, guys. I forgot.
Sasha gave me this note.
Something about switching up the teams.
That sound important, Sprig.
Let us read it together.
"Dear nerds,
I, Sasha, order you to switch partners.
Sprig should be with Ivy since they're dating."
Hmm.
Well, it certainly sounds legit.
Let's switch it up then. Sasha is a tactical wizard.
Mucking about with her decisions could have devastating consequences.
(whistle blowing)
Shift change.
(both grunt)
(kisses)
(grunting)
(whirring)
Boom! Now, all we've got to wait for that force field to come down.
Uh, boy.
Don't know why old Stumpy was picked to go uphill.
This sure is a hand climb.
You doing okay back there, Fern?
Look, Cutsy, that "cloud" looks like a cloud. (chuckles)
(Stumpy) Fern, get a move on!
(sighs)
We finally made it.
Now, let's shut down this generator with no one the wiser.
(beeping)
Oh, dear frog!
(siren blaring) On your guard, Fern!
(screams)
Hmm, think the shield is down yet?
Let's check!
-(electricity crackles) -(screams)
Ouch!
Huh, it's still up.
Well, we can't expect Fern and Stumpy to work as good together as we do.
Good call. (grunts)
Let's give them a little extra time.
You wanna work on our couple's dance routine?
Which one?
(upbeat music playing)
(both panting)
Nailed it!
(sighs) Okay, only two minutes left.
Let's try this one more time.
(electricity crackles) (screams)
(grunts)
It hurts so much.
You thinking what I'm thinking? Try the shield again?
No. Stumpy and Fern are in trouble.
Come on!
Fern, Stumpy!
What happened?
Sprig, I think it might be a--
Ambush!
(screams) (grunts)
Yeah, like, what he said.
(screams)
This was not in the mission briefing!
Holy crab! (grunts)
(both grunting)
(both gasp, scream)
(screams)
(all panting)
(all screaming)
(grunts)
Only one minute left and this mission's a bust!
We're done for!
(all grunting)
Look! That's where the generator is getting its power.
Fern, if I can keep that thing busy, can you cut those wires and shut it down?
Gladly.
Sprig, take Stumpy to the cannon!
Me and Fern will get the shield sown.
Right! Let's go, Stumpy. And, Ivy...
(sobbing) ...I'll miss you so much.
I'll count every second until we're back together.
And not judt 'cause I have to for the mission.
Oh, for Pete's sake! We're going!
No, Ivy! I miss you already!
I think that guy likes you.
(whirring)
(raspberry)
Ha!
Looks like you're due for a cut!
(screams)
Okay, let's see if these shields are still up.
I wouldn't recommend that.
-(electricity crackles) -Oh, yeah.
Your spatula hand is made out of bone.
That doesn't conduct electricity.
So that's why Sasha picked you.
Come on, girls. Come on!
Let's lower them ears!
And done!
Dang! That looks good.
(powering down)
(shield powering down)
It's down! Go time!
(door squeaks)
Looks like five oughta do the trick.
Oh, no!
The new shift? We're too late!
You do your job, Stumpy,
and let me do mine.
(beeping)
That should do it.
Let's get out of here, kid.
Yes!
Nice work, guys. Looks like the mission was a success.
Actually, Sasha...
You and Ivy ignored my orders and almost beefed the entire mission
because you couldn't spend five minutes apart?
That is... surprisingly accurate.
I separated you two because I needed two of our best commandos
protecting two of our best specialists,
so they could do their jobs.
(both) Oh!
Oh, yeah! Oh, I see.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yep, we're dumb.
But you still managed to pull off the mission.
So I'm only sort of furious.
Hey, Sprig. I really like where our relationship is headed, but...
Maybe we shouldn't let it dictate every decision we make in our lives?
Yep. Wait, you guys are dating?
And I'm glad y'all learned your lessons
and we ain't dead.
Cheerio, my good frogs.
The Ribbiton state is here to pledge its full support for your rebellion.
Thanks, Wigbert. Your supplies are really going to make a difference.
What the...
