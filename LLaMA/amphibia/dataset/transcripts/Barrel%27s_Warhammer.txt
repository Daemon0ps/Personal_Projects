Captain Bufo: So, the disgraced Captain Grime called this council meeting? Does anyone have any idea why?
Captain Beatrix: Maybe he wants to be surrounded by friends when he gets arrested. What do you think, Aldo?
(popping)
Bufo: Uh, is he asleep or dead?
Beatrix: Definitely smells dead.
(all laughing)
Braddock: Not exactly a welcoming crowd.
Percy: Especially that Captain Beatrix! What's her problem?
Grime: Her problem is that she's my sister. And I may have teased her quite a bit when we were tadpoles.
What?
Get out!
Braddock: That's it! Stick a fork in us. We're done.
Sasha: Enough loser talk. We can do this. Just remember what we practiced and keep your eye on the prize.
Percy: Ooh! That reminds me... I have one last touch for our outfits. Now we really are a team.
Grime: One eye. I see what you did there.
Sasha: Nice one, Perce! Now, come on everyone. Let's get out there and impress some toads... or we die!
(all) Whoo!
Dang it, Beatrix. What's your brother waiting for?
(thud)
(drumroll)
(pop music playing)
(all gasp)
(groans, grunts)
(grunts)
Grime: (clears throat) My fellow toads. For years, we have kept the kingdom's servants in line. But are we not just servants ourselves? I propose a future where toads overthrow King Andrias, and take our rightful place as rulers of all Amphibia!
Sasha: Psst. Drop the mic.
Grime: Oh! Uh, right!
(feedback)
(crickets chirping)
You all took a huge risk coming here to gain support for your rebellion.
And it paid off. We frogging loved it!
(cheering)
Ow! Ow!
Beatrix: Nicely done, Grimothy.
Sasha: No way! Is your real name...
Grime: You're not talking about this!
Bufo: So tell us, tell us, who's leading this revolution?
Grime: I was thinking... us?
(Bufo and Beatrix whisper to each other.)
Bufo: Yeah, I don't think so. We love your vision, but no toad is going to follow the command of a fugitive and his hummus.
Sasha: Humans. We're called humans.
Beatrix: Bufo's right. Just because King Andrias is working with a couple of hummuses doesn't mean us toads will go for it.
Sasha: Wait, other humans? They must be talking about Anne and Marcy. I don't believe it. They're working together? Without me?
Grime: And apparently aiding the crown.
Bufo: Speaking of which, this whole thing is beginning to sound too risky. Guards! Arrest them!
(grunting)
(Sasha screams in anger and charges at the toads.)
Grime: Sasha, no!
(screaming)
(grunting)
(grunts)
Sasha: Listen here, you buffoon! What's it gonna take to prove than you should follow us?
(growling)
Aldo: Barrel's Warhammer.
Bufo: Barrel's Hammer? You've finally gone senile, Aldo.
Beatrix: Yeah, that's a suicide mission.
Aldo: It is said that the one who wields this hammer is the true leader of all toads. It is the one thing, the only thing, that will prove we should follow you.
Sasha: Great! Done! You'll have it in your Crypt-keeper hands by morning.
Bufo, Beatrix: (both gasp, laugh)
Bufo: No toad has ever gone after the hammer and made it back alive. This I've gotta see.
Sasha: So, what's this hammer, and why are y'all so scared of it?
A little late to be asking, don't you think?
It's the weapon of the legendary toad warrior, Barrel the Brave!
Barrel gave his life defending a helpless village from a terrifying beast!
Legend has it that this same beast guards his hammer to this very day.
Enough whimpering! We don't even know if this tadpole tale is real.
Listen, if things get too wild out here, just give me a signal and I'll call the whole thing off.
A signal? What kind of signal?
Hmm. How about this? Do your best kawaii pose. It's something we do for photos in my world. Like this.
- What's a photo?
- Just try it.
(laughs)
No giggling!
We're here.
(screeching)
Hey, Sash.
Thanks for that.
I feel better already.
Sasha: Hey, my pleasure. And don't forget, just strike a pose and we'll leave.
According to the map Aldo gave us,
we should be close to where the Hammer was last seen.
This is insane.
Even if it exists, we'll never find it.
Found it!
I don't believe it. It's real. (laughs)
Our ticket to revolution!
And no beast in sight!
Could life actually be this easy for a change?
Quick, Grime-sy! Yank that thing out already.
(straining, sighs)
(straining) A little help here.
Okay, gang. On three.
One, two, three.
(all straining)
The (stammers) beast!
Look alive! Who knows where it'll come from...
(all screaming)
(gasps)
(grunting)
(roaring)
(laughs) What a great way to go!
(roaring continues)
Sorry, guys, but we're way too close to bail.
I am not going back empty-handed.
But... You said...
Steer us closer. We need to get it to attack us.
(both) What? Trust me!
(Grime strains)
(grunting)
(clinking)
(growls)
Sasha: All right, now we've got its attention. Get ready. Three, two, one, now!
(both scream, grunt)
Percy, Braddock: (both) Whoa!
(grunting)
(grunts, strains)
(screams)
Percy: Ah, man. That was my mom's boat.
(grunts, strains)
(all straining)
(groans)
Sasha: This thing's never coming loose!
(Sasha lets go of the hammer and runs to the narwhal worm's horn. She throws her cape aside and pulls out a lasso. She swings the lasso around and throws it up at the horn.)
(grunting)
(growls)
(all screaming)
Percy, Braddock: (both screaming, grunting)
(screaming)
Grime: What do you think you're doing?!
Sasha: What's it look like?! I'm getting the Warhammer back to the tower!
Grime: You're insane and I love it!
Percy, Braddock: (both screaming)
Toad Scientist: Last Toad Summit was all about improvements to Toad armor durability. This year, the R & D team gives you armor customization.
(all cheer)
Bufo: Ooh, that ducky looks nice.
Lady Toad Soldier: Whoo, yeah.
(monster growls)
Lady Toad Soldier: Hey Greg, what do you think that is?
(Greg, the toad wearing a "Toadz Rule!!" shirt, turns around with a pair of binoculars.)
Greg: Hmm, that's clearly a narwhal-worm being ridden by a hummus, heading straight for us.
(Greg and the lady toad exchange glances, then both scream.)
(growls)
Percy: Sasha... please... stop this!
Sasha: But we're almost there!
Grime: (gasps) The tower! It's coming up too fast. We're going to crash into it. Go left! Go left!
Sasha: (gasps, grunts)
(The Narwhal worm growls, whistle blows)
Sasha: (strains) I can't! I've lost control of it!
(both grunting)
Grime: There must be another way to stop it.
Sasha: The Warhammer. It's the only weapon big enough to dent this thing's armor.
(both straining)
Grime: (sighs) It's no use. Sasha, we've got to get out of here or we'll all die.
Sasha: No! I can do this! I am not gonna fail! Not while Anne and Marcy are getting by without me!
(groans)
(straining)
Sasha: Ha! (groans) Whoa!
(Grime grunts)
(both screaming)
(grunts)
(both screaming)
(Grime grunts)
(growls)
(Greg and the lady toad scream at the approaching worm.)
(all gasp)
Aldo, Bufo, Beatrix: Huh?
Sasha: One Warhammer as promised.
(all exclaim)
(all cheer)
Aldo: We hereby grant you the support of all three towers for your rebellion.
Sasha: Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Grime: Well, Lieutenant, I had my doubts, but we did it.
Sasha: Of course, we did. After all, we're the best team in this or any other world. Right, Braddock? Percy?
Percy, Braddock: (both scream)
Sasha: Whoa, you guys okay?
Percy: "Okay"? Sasha, we almost died back there.
Braddock: We trusted you, and you didn't care one bit about what happened to us as long as you got what you wanted.
Sasha: That's not true. Besides, we did it.
Percy: No, Sasha, you did it. And I think me and Braddock are done with this. With all of it.
Sasha: What? Where are you going? Guys, come back. You're not actually gonna throw this all away, are you? We are so close. I can feel it.
Percy: Goodbye, Sash. We hope you pull it off. We really do.
Grime: That's enough, Lieutenant.
Sasha: Get out of my way, Grime.
Grime: Just let them go, Sasha. We all have our limits. It looks like they finally hit theirs.
Sasha: But-
Grime: I know it hurts. But remember, every dream has its price, and not everyone's willing to pay it. Now come on, soldier. We've got a world to conquer.
Sasha: Goodbye, Percy. Goodbye, Braddock.
(snoring)
