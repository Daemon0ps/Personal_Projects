Maddie: Seed of swordspine, one cup of dirt from a widow's grave, add both to bubbling bog water, and finally, one half drop of worm snake venom. Steady... steady...
Rosemary, Lavender and Ginger: Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie!
Maddie: Hi, Rosemary, Ginger, and Lavender. What are you doing here?
Rosemary: Hey, sis! You promise you play with us, remember?
Maddie: I'm in a middle of a spell. We can play tomorrow.
Ginger: That's what you said yesterday.
Maddie: Look, Mrs. Jonkins is counting on me to bring her pet, Fleafy, back to life.
(bird caws)
Maddie: Hey, hey! Get out of here! Necromancy is really advanced magic. It said that only level two witches can pull it off. I've only done level spells up so-
Ginger: Boo! Magic is boring!
Lavender: And creepy. Let's play instead!
Rosemary: Remember when you used to juggle us?
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Juggle us! Juggle us!
Maddie: Fine, give me a few minutes to wrap this up, and we'll play.
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Yay!
Maddie: Almost there... (laughs)
Rosemary: What happened to a few minutes?
Maddie: Aah!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Aah!
Maddie: No! That took all morning!
Maddie: Uh, oh.
Marcy: Crockside conifer. What a find! And they said compiling a plant-cyclopedia would be boring.
Maddie and the Sisters: Aah!
Marcy: That doesn't sound good. (Finds Maddie and her sisters, gets excited) No froggin' way! A curse user?! Here?!
Maddie: What's the matter with you three?!
Rosemary: We were just trying to play with you.
Maddie: Well now I definitely don't have time. Go home and help dad with the bakery or something. I swear, sometimes, I wish you three would grow up.
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Aww.
Maddie: (groans)
Marcy: Okay, Marce. Be cool. Just get out there and introduce yourself with confidence.
Marcy: Hi, there!
Maddie: Aah!
Marcy: My name's Marcy!
Maddie: Oh, oops. You're Anne's friend, right?
Marcy: Oh, my gosh! That was the coolest thing ever! Some kind of low-grade fire curse?
Maddie: (intrigued) I'm impressed you knew that! Do you also have an interest in the dark arts?
Marcy: Are you kidding?! I've read every Cynthia Coven book, five times! I searched all over Newtopia for someone who could teach me, but magic users are so rare these days.
Maddie: (even more impressed) Wow! No one's ever interested in what I do! They usually run away screaming!
Marcy: Baby, I'm running towards you! How do you feel about that?
Maddie: I'm feeling like a beautiful friendship is about to start. Wanna be my apprentice and help me bring a dead flea back to life?
Marcy: (puts her bangs over her right eye) Do I ever!
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs)
Maddie: If we're gonna bring this flea back to life, we need a few more ingredients. First up, bile of a vomit bird.
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs)
Maddie: Then, some big ol' ticks.
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs and screams)
Maddie: A really rotted corpse.
Maddie: No. No. Hey, perfect!
Hop Pop: Did you girls mistake me for a corpse?!
Marcy: Of "corpse" not, Hop Pop.
Maddie: Fresh soil from a graveyard.
Maddie: Assorted limbs.
Maddie: And lastly, a high-five from your new best bud.
Maddie: Well, this is me. (groans). I hope my sisters are asleep. I do not want to deal with them right now.
Marcy: What's wrong with your little sisters?
Maddie: It's a long story. I used to play with them all the time. Especially, juggling; that was their favorite. Then, I got my own interests. Magic became my passion, my calling. I didn't have time to waste on kids stuff anymore. And ever since then, they've been so annoying.
Marcy: As someone who goes hard into her hobbies, I relate. But, don't you think you should still make time for them occasionally?
Maddie: Nonsense. Being a witch is a big responsibility, Marcy. I've got more important things to do now than babysit.
Marcy: Well, you are the master. See you at the sacrificial grove tomorrow for an unholy ritual!
Maddie and Marcy: (the do their own unique handshake) Creepy spiders!
Marcy: (squeals) Can't wait!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (groans)
Rosemary: I can't believe it! Maddie replaced us?
Ginger: Why did she want to hang out with that stupid old lady?
Lavender: I wish we were older. And then, Maddie would want to play with us like she used to.
Rosemary: That's it! That's it! That's it! We just have to use one of Maddie's witchy spells to grow up!
Lavender: Grow up?
Ginger: And then we'll be older and Maddie will want to play with us again!
Rosemary and Lavender: Yeah!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (cackles)
Mr. Flour: Night girls!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (innocent eyes) Good night, daddy.
(The next day, Mr. Flour is checking on his bread as Maddie comes downstairs.)
Mr. Flour: (not turning around) Morning, daughter.
Maddie: Dad, have you seen my spell book? I need to perform a level 2 resurrection with my apprentice.
Mr. Flour: Well, I think I saw your sisters with it.
Maddie: Aah! I'm gonna kill them! (runs back upstairs)
Mr. Flour: Well, make sure you resurrect them when you're done.
Maddie: What have I told you about playing with my stuff?!
Lavender: We're not playing, we're making a witchy spell.
Maddie: (gasps) Oh, what did you do to my book?! It's ruined! This is why I don't spend time with you anymore because you're annoying, little babies!
Rosemary: Won't be babies for much longer.
Marcy: Check it out! My first successful curse! Some kind of horrible abomination!
Flower: (yodels)
Marcy: (covers the flower's mouth) Okay, that's enough. You okay?
Maddie: I'm so done with my sisters. Look what they did to my spell book!
Marcy: Yeesh. They didn't even color in the lines.
Flower: Tsk tsk tsk tsk.
Maddie: Whatever. They won't stop me from reaching level two. Let's get to resurrecting.
Marcy: (gasps) It's alive. It's alive! Or there's a slight breeze.
Maddie and Marcy: (gasps)
Maddie: We did it! We did it! I'm finally a level 2 witch! (notices a growing shadow and looks up) Huh?
Ginger: Maddie!
Maddie and Marcy: (screams)
Maddie: Fleafy!
Marcy: Holy cow!
Ginger: Found you!
Maddie: Wait, Ginger?!
Ginger: You wanted us grown up.
Rosemary: So, here we are!
Maddie: Oh, no they didn't!
Marcy: Didn't what?
Lavender: Come on Maddie, play with us!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Hide and seek!
Maddie and Marcy: (screams)
