(all yawn)
Oh, boy.
King Andrias: Wonderful to see you all again.
Your Majesty.
'Sup, King?
King Andrias: So ask me if I found out anything about the box.
Anne: Did you...
King Andrias: Bingo! (laughs) Ta-da! Take a gander.
(Everyone gasps as they look at the gigantic book and the content within it.)
Sprig: It's the music box!
King Andrias: According to this book, it's a magical artifact that is thousands of years old. Apparently, my ancestors used it to visit entirely different worlds. They were peaceful explorers, scientists, if you will. These three stones are the key to getting it working again. They need to be recharged.
Anne: Recharged? How?
King Andrias: The book mentions three different temples, each channeling a different kind of energy. And once the stones are recharged...
Anne: We'll have a way home?
King Andrias: Steal my thunder, why don't you? But yes! Boom! Eh, eh?
Anne: I don't believe it. A real chance to get home.
Marcy: Right? Now let's get out there and conquer these bad boys.
Whoo-hoo!
King Andrias: Whoa-ho. Let's rein those snails in for a sec. The book only gives the location of one temple. Besides, you still have a lot of preparing to do before you set off.
Marcy: Good point. Gotta get equipped for a mega-quest like this. Armor to buy, maps to study, weapons to forge. This is gonna take a few days.
Hop Pop: Few days, huh? Well, I hate to say it, but we really need to get back to Wartwood. The harvest is coming up and we can't miss it.
Anne: Okay, Marce, me and the Plantars will head back to Wartwood, and when you're ready we can just meet up.
Marcy: Whoa, whoa, whoa. It doesn't really make sense for you to go back to Wartwood.
Anne: Say what now?
(all) What?
Marcy: The last thing we should do is separate again, now that we're so close to finding our way home.
Anne: I guess that's true, but, uh, I, uh, need to go to Wartwood to get the music box. Right, H.P.?
Hop Pop: Technically, yes.
Marcy: Nonsense. Once Hop Pop gets the box back, we'll just send a servant to pick it up. More efficient that way.
Anne: Yeah, but...
Marcy: Anne, right now you have to follow your head, not your heart. The Plantars got you here, to me. It's time to let them get back to their lives. Why don't you guys take the day to say goodbye?
(all groan)
King Andrias: You folks want a giant tissue? Seriously, you would not believe the size of these tissues. (chuckles) I'll get you one.
(whimpers)
(Hop Pop, Polly, and Sprig sigh)
Hey, guys, come on. It's not like this is goodbye forever.
You know what, gang? Anne's right. The least we can do is have a fun last day together.
Now come on, let's pick an activity.
There's the opera house, the coliseum, the aquarium.
(Anne) There's an aquarium? That's perfect. Anytime I was feeling gloomy back home, the aquarium would always make me feel better. There's nothing more peaceful than being surrounded by water and sea creatures.
Oh, good thinking, Anne.
Works for me.
Yeah! Let's go have fun and not think about our crippling sadness.
Nice one.
(children) Ooh.
(chattering, laughing)
(chitters)
Look at the beaver bugs. They're so cute.
What'd I tell you? The perfect place to relax and take our minds off...
(all scream)
(chuckles) Oh, hey. Check it out. It's the same kinda eel that attacked you kids when the basement flooded, remember? Kids?
(sighs) Those were good times, weren't they?
Yeah, it's too bad that they're over.
(whimpers)
No! No, Sprig. Fight the sadness. Fight it. Come on, buddy. Come here. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. (both whimpering)
Okay, River Room is a bust. Let's keep moving.
Okay, if we're gonna have a sadness-free day, we need to avoid anything that might trigger our very delicate emotional states.
Actually, this is pretty peaceful.
-Yeah. -So soothing.
(all sigh)
(growling)
-Hey, look, a kraken. -It is. Ha!
Anne, it's like the one you tried to cook up at Stumpy's.
Who knew fish sauce and fear of death went so well together?
(all whimpering, crying)
Okay, that's enough. Time to change rooms, everybody.
(all panting)
Oh, cool. A marine geology exhibit.
Nothing to remind us of our adventures in here.
Wow, this coral is so neat.
Oh, look, that stalk looks exactly like...
(all gasp) Hop Pop's cane!
-(Hop Pop) My cane. -Oh, no. That one looks like...
-(all) Domino 2. -(gasps)
Sprig: The cannibal couple from the inn!
Polly: (gasps) Mud Men!
Anne: Grubhog!
Hop Pop: Zapapedes!
Sprig: Veggie-robo!
Anne: (sobbing) Who knew coral came in such variety?
(all crying)
Excuse me, folks, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Your misery is scaring the efts.
(cries)
Hoop. No emotion.
(sighs) Sorry, guys. Looks like my grand plan for a sadness-free day at the aquarium is a total bust.
Well, If you folks are feeling blue, you could try the Stingray Stage Show. Always cheers me up.
Ooh, a stage show? Those are the best. Wait. Did we have any run-ins with stingrays? Anything even slightly resembling a stingray?
Nope.
Don't think so.
Then let's go.
(all) Whoo!
Show's that way, folks.
(crowd cheering)
All right, give it up for our stingrays, Sugar Ray and Billy Ray. And now for the main event, II'll need a volunteer.
-Oh, oh, me, me.
-You, the pink frog over there!
Come on down.
(crowd cheering, whistling)
What's your name, and where are you from?
-Sprig Plantar from Wartwood.
-Wartwood represent!
Well, Sprig Plantar, all you gotta do is put this fish in your hands and hold it out over the tank.
Sprig: And the stingray will jump out and eat it?
Usually, but we have a very special guest today. Everyone put your hands together for Wanda the Water Snake.
(hisses)
(both gasp)
Hop Pop: Well, that's pretty cool... Wait, what's wrong?
Anne: It looks exactly like the water snake that almost ate me and Sprig.
Hop Pop: What? When?
Anne: That was the day you tried to lock us in the house!
Hop Pop: I knew it! You two always... (starts crying) ...disobeying and causing trouble!
Polly: That was the day I realized you weren't going to eat us!
(all crying)
Now, Wanda will leap up and eat the fish right out of this lucky kiddo's hand. And so long as he doesn't do anything to surprise her, this should be perfectly safe.
Oh, no! Sprig's about to...
-(growls) -(whimpering)
(crying)
(screams)
(sobs)
We've gotta get Sprig away from that snake.
Oh, you've got nothing to fear from ol' Wanda. The gal's afraid of her own shadow.
That's a relief. Close call.
Oh, no, no, no. It's the rays you should be worried about. Yeah, they love the taste of frog flesh.
(sobbing)
Sprig!
Hey, buddy, you set 'em up...
(gasps) I'll knock 'em down.
(grunts) (growls)
(growls) (grunts)
(whimpers)
(growls)
(grunting)
Over here, Hop Pop!
Bleh!
Bleh! (grunts)
Mmm. (growls)
(whimpers)
Whoa!
(snarls)
You're up, Polly.
(grunts) (gargles, spits)
Yes, be free.
(all) Yeah!
And stay out!
Oh, man. That was classic.
We stung those stingrays.
Well, we didn't have a relaxing day at the aquarium.
But now we've got another perfectly us-memory to cherish.
(all laughing)
(birds squawking)
Have a safe trip back, Plantars.
Let us know when you get the music box, and we'll send someone to come get it.
Thank you kindly, Marcy.
No more tears, y'all. We'll see each other again.
Will we, though? When?
I don't know, but we're family, and family always finds each other.
(both) Spranne against the world!
(both laugh)
(sighs) I'm sorry, Anne. This just made the most sense.
I know. I know. (sniffles) Logical thing to do.
Marcy: (sighs) You know, the more I think about it, maybe sending a servant to get the music box isn't such a good idea. We need someone looking after that thing the second Hop Pop gets it back. Someone we trust.
(Anne turns to Marcy.)
Marcy: I'm sure I can handle the preparations here by myself. I'll just come pick you up on the way to the first... (grunts when Anne hugs her) ...temple.
Anne: Thanks, Marcy.
Marcy: (chuckles) Now go. Follow your heart.
Anne: Okay, later! Bye!
(squawks)
Doris: You go get 'em, girl!
Anne: See you, Doris!
Sewer Gator: Whoo-hoo-hoo.
(horn honks)
Oh, so safety doesn't matter now?
Gertie: Wanna try my new gnatchos, Anne?
Anne: Some other time, Gertie!
(all sigh)
-(chirps) -(all scream)
What in the... Anne?
Anne: I'm coming with you to Wartwood!
Yeah!
Glad to have you back, Anne.
Hop on up here, sister.
Thank frog! I really didn't know how I was gonna make it without you.
Now let's go home.
King Andrias: Always sad to see someone go, isn't it? I have a proposition for you, Marcy, and I think you'll find it very interesting.
