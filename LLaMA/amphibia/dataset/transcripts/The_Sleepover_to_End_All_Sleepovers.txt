(Open on a tower of Newtopia Castle at night. Inside Marcy, in her pajamas is watering a potted flytrap.)
Marcy: Watering the plants, watering the plants.
(snarls)
Marcy: (screams) Branson! No, bad boy.
(knocking)
Marcy: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. They're here!
Lady Olivia: Good evening, Master Marcy. Anne Boonchuy and the Plantars have arrived for your...
(all) Sleepover!
(both) Sleepover, sleepover!
Polly: (in slow motion) Sleepover.
Olivia: (sighs) Sleepover. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the kitchen drinking... juice.
(Anne squeals and hugs Marcy, causing her to grunt from the impact.)
Anne: This is gonna be...
Marcy: Awesome!
Sprig: It's the perfect way to spend the night before we hear from the king.
Anne: I wonder what he learned about the music box.
Marcy: I don't wanna give anything away, but it's gonna be pretty cool.
Hop Pop: Okay, kids, I'll be back in the morning for our meeting with the king. You enjoy yourselves. I'm off to spend a little much needed me time. And by me time, I mean a full body...
Okay, bye, H.P.
Later, Hop Pop.
Polly: Whoo-hoo! Me and Sprig's first sleepover.
Sprig: Better make it a good one. (whispering) These will be formative memories.
Anne: Whoa, I just realized, we've never done a sleepover without Sasha.
Marcy: Oh, you're right. You think we can pull it off? Sasha's the sleepover queen, not us.
Pfft. Who says there has to be just one queen?
Everyone. That's sort of how the whole system works, Anne.
Marcy, you and I have done tons of sleepovers. We know everything about them.
(both) Pajamas, junk food and gossip galore. Pillow fights, movies and tearing up the dance floor. And listen up 'cause this I won't repeat, never ever go to sleep.
(laughs)
Sensing some missing context here.
Oh, sorry. Sasha always said falling asleep early means total failure.
A true sleepover goes till sunrise.
Enough setup. Let's get our sleepover on, baby.
Whoo-hoo! Let's do it!
(all) Whoo-hoo!
(clattering) Cowabunga!
Yeah! (chuckles)
(laughs)
Excuse me, sire.
Yes, peon?
(grunts)
(screams) Oh, for frog's sake.
(all grunting, screaming)
While I'm glad you kids are having fun...
(all groaning) ...let me remind you
that some castle rooms are off-limits,
namely the basement, which is...
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha! (screams)
Montage is back on, baby.
(all laughing) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
(Anne laughs)
(burps)
(yawns) That was awesome.
Best sleepover ever.
See, told ya we could pull off
an awesome sleepover without Sasha.
What time is it anyway? 5:00 a.m.? 6:00 a.m.?
Uh, only 9:00 p.m.?
-What? -(chuckles) That early?
But I'm so tired.
(Anne) No, stay awake! (both groaning)
Anne, I think it's time.
Really? Are you sure they're ready?
Is anyone ever really ready, Anne?
Ready? Ready for what?
(both) The Scare-Dare challenge.
Oooh.
The rules. One of us comes up with a scary dare,
and we all have to do it.
But whoever bails first gets their name added to...
-The Book of Losers. -(both gasp)
Yeah, and once your name is in the Book of Losers,
it'll be there forever.
(in deep voice) Forever.
Well, I'm sold. Let's do this.
Okay, all we need is a scary dare.
(all) Hmm, hmm, hmm.
-Yeah, I got nada. -Huh.
I don't remember it being this difficult.
That's because Sasha always came up with the best scare dares.
Oh, right. All right, what have we got to work with here?
Oh, what about the basement? Ow, paper cut.
Anne, that place is probably off-limits for a reason.
This may not be a smart idea.
Come on, Marce. It's what Sasha would do.
Well, that is true.
I hereby accept this Scare-Dare challenge.
We also accept this Scare-Dare challenge!
It is done. This Scare-Dare challenge is now...
(all in deep voices) ...official.
(snoring)
(chuckles)
(all coughing)
(all) Whoa.
So, who wants to go first?
I vote Anne. What? Why?
Well, it was your idea.
(gulps)
-(grunts) -Marcy!
(Marcy screams) Oh, no. Why am I going...
(screams)
(groans)
(gasps)
(all screaming)
Okay, that's enough.
Whoa, that's a lot of mirrors.
So, anyone wanna turn back and go into the Book of Losers?
(nervous chuckle) You kidding me?
Not me. As if.
You know, some cultures believe mirrors can ward off
malevolent spirits, or summon them.
(sinister laughing)
(both) Ooh.
Uh, Marcy, what does this say?
My command of Newtopian linguistics is limited,
but what it says should be fairly obvious.
(all) Keep out.
(door creaks) (all scream)
Okay, somebody's gotta wanna go back by now.
(shivering) I ain't going in no Book of Losers.
(shivering) Me n-neither.
Guess we'll go a bit further then.
Uh-huh. Living my best life right now.
(all straining)
What the heck?
It's some kind of creepy crypt.
Whoa-ho. You mean like with dead bodies? Cool.
Anne, we shouldn't be here.
This feels all sorts of wrong.
Guys, I, uh, think Marcy's right.
We should head back upstairs.
Oh, I see. So I guess you two are okay with going in...
(both) ...the Book of Losers.
Pfft. We don't wanna go back 'cause we're scared.
This place just isn't our style.
Okay, prove it.
Take a selfie by that coffin.
(both) Ew!
Would Sasha do this? Oh, yeah.
I have to admit... It is pretty creepy.
All right, say desecration.
(both) Desecration.
Ha! Nailed it. Oh, wait.
This photo's kinda jank.
(squeals)
(both scream)
What the heck are these things?
(both scream)
Hey, they're actually kinda cute.
-(Marcy) Sprig, don't touch it! -(Anne) Look!
(growls)
(screams) They're gonna eat our bones.
Forget this. We're losers. We lose.
(both screaming)
I don't get it. Are they aliens? Ghosts?
Does it matter? Let's get outta here, Scoob.
Roger that. Wait, what did you just call me?
(both scream) Guys, this way!
We found another exit!
(all panting) (moaning)
(Anne) Man, someone really loves mirrors.
(all scream)
(all panting)
What the... A garden?
But how are these plants growing so well without sunlight?
Mar-Mar, we don't have time for this. Come on!
(growling)
(all panting)
Whoa, someone really hated this painting.
Aaah! Hurry up!
(roaring)
(all panting)
Come on, put your backs into it.
My room? Don't question it.
Oh, thank goodness that's...
-(all screaming) -Holy toot!
Take this, you overgrown gummy worm.
(squeals)
-Quick! More books. -Way ahead of you.
-(grunts) -This isn't working.
Why are the books passing right through them?
Maybe they prefer audiobooks.
(grunts)
(moans)
(grunts)
(moaning, squeals)
What the...
(moaning)
(grunts)
It's physical? But how?
(both) The mirrors.
Both hallways to the crypt were filled with mirrors.
It looks like the refraction of their own light turns these creatures physical,
which means...
Quick, everyone, grab a mirror.
Yah!
(strains)
Hey, was anyone gonna tell me I have leaves in my hair?
(Marcy, Polly, Sprig) Not now, Anne. Oh, right, sorry. Yah!
(grunting) (whimpers)
(all panting)
So, anyone think they're going to be able
to sleep after that terrifying experience?
Nope. Nuh-uh.
Oh, heck, nah.
(alarm buzzes)
Welp, we did it.
We stayed awake all night.
Oh, I still have so many questions.
What were those things? What's the deal with the basement?
And if those were really ghosts, is there actually an afterlife?
I didn't even think about that.
Well, one thing's for sure.
That sleepover was amazing.
It was the best.
(sighs) I just wish I didn't have to add my name to the Book of Losers.
(blows raspberry) Me either.
Hand me that pen. You're not the only losers.
I was scared outta my mind.
Me too. (chuckles)
It's not the first time either.
(Polly) For real? (Marcy) Have a look.
(Sprig) Whoa. Your names are in here a bunch of times.
Yep, the only one brave enough to never get in the book was Sasha.
(sighs) We have to find her, Marcy.
I need to make things right.
We will, Anne. I just know it.
-(knocking) -(all scream)
Rise and shine, kids.
Because of you, I barely slept a wink last night.
Ugh, well, whatever. It's go time.
Your audience with King Andrias is about to begin.
Get ready!
(all laughing)
(giggles)
(all screaming)
