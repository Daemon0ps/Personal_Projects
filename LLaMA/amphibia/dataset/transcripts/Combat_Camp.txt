Sprig: I still can't believe you're bringing us to a day care, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Look. I'm sorry, okay? But I have to go to the Annual Crop Convention. It's a long ways away, and I can't leave you kids on the farm alone for the weekend.
Sprig, Polly, & Anne: What?
Anne: Ugh! Are you kidding?
Hop Pop: Wish I was, Anne. But you kids need supervision. Why, sometimes it feels like we have at least two wacky adventures a week!
Hop Pop: Here we are!
Tritonio: Greetings, I am Tritonio Espada, the instructor of this day care.
Hop Pop: Huh, I thought Briar and Iris Bogwater ran this place.
Tritonio: The Bogwaters retired last year and sold their business to me.
Hop Pop: Well in that case, I'm Hopediah Plantar. This here is Sprig, Polly and Anne.
(Polly blows a raspberry. Hop Pop gestures to Anne.)
Hop Pop: She may be gigantic, but she's also a child.
Anne: Hey!
Tritonio: Ah, yes. I shall educate them! Teach them true discipline!
Hop Pop: Oh. I like the cut of your jib, Mr. Tray-tony. Did I say that right?
Tritonio: Absolutely not.
Sprig: This isn't so bad, I guess. There is a cool tower.
Anne: You guys don't get it. And Tritonio's a teacher, enemy of all that is good.
Sprig: Uh, what's so bad about teachers?
Anne: Let's just say, me and them don't mix.
Math Teacher: Okay, so then you carry the three and-- (sighs)
(video game noises)
Math Teacher: Not again.
(noises continue)
Anne: You'll never take me alive!
Math Teacher: Anne! Anne, get back here!
Anne: Teachers. They just don't like me. Probably cuz they're jealous of my carefree spirit.
Hop Pop: Well, kids, looks like you're in good hands here with Mr. Tritonio. Hyah! Crop Con, here I come!
Tritonio: Finally. It is just us now. So let us cast aside these illusions, yes? (tears off his clothes, revealing another suit underneath) Ah!
Anne, Sprig, & Polly: Whoa!
Tritonio: And this is no mere day care. This is a Combat Crash Course for kids.
Polly: Yoo-hoo!
Sprig: Cool!
Tritonio: Adults, they shelter their children. I say no! (kicks a stick up to him) Teach them to fight. For danger lurks around every corner of Amphibia. Stay on your toes! Trust no one! Ah! Look over there! (points behind Sprig)
Sprig: Ah! What is it? Danger?
(Tritonio hits him, making him grunt)
Tritonio: I said trust no one! Now, follow me, and we will begin the next lesson.
Sprig: Hit me again, Tritonio! (laughs)
Polly: This guy's awesome!
Anne: Eh, we'll see.
(Cut to inside the tower.)
Tritonio: Your next lesson is to pick your weapon. Find one that resonates with you.
Anne: Cool!
Polly: Yeah!
(Polly hops over to a bucket of mushrooms with skulls painted on them.)
Polly: Ooh, what are these?
Tritonio: Ah, the noble boom shroom. Small, unassuming, but in the right hands... (pushes on the stem, which causes the boom shroom to blink and make a beeping sound) Explosive!
(Tritonio throws the boom shroom, which explodes into a cloud of blue smoke.)
Polly: (gasps) Oh.
Tritonio: Perfect for you, I think. (hands Polly the boom shroom) Who's next? No wrong answers.
(Anne is standing near a stack of three swords.)
Anne: Hmm.
(She reaches for a sword, but Tritonio suddenly pops up from behind the stack.)
Tritonio: No! Wrong!
Anne: What? How so?
Tritonio: From what I have seen, you do not have the dexterity to wield a sword. Pick something else.
(Sprig walks up with a pair of sai daggers.)
Sprig: Whoa, these are big forks.
Tritonio: Ah, excellent choice, Sprig.
(explosion booms)
(Polly laughs)
Polly: So, what's the next lesson?
(The scene cuts to a tire-running course.)
Tritonio: Wonderful, Sprig! (Polly hops through the tires) Polly, truly inspiring. (Anne steps into a tire) No, Anne. Knees higher!
(The next lesson is monkey bars. Sprig uses his tongue to swing through.)
Sprig: Blah!
Tritonio: Sprig, Polly, nice work!
(Anne starts following them.)
Tritonio: No, Anne. More nimble!
(Anne grumbles, but then the bars break, causing her to fall and shout.)
(The next lesson is wall climbing.)
Tritonio: That's it, children! Feel the stone beneath your hands, the strong breeze in your hair. Much like the breeze on a fast-moving train.
Sprig: Man, Tritonio's so encouraging.
Anne: (sarcastically) Must be nice.
Tritonio: Anne, your hand placement is all wrong!
Anne: Ugh, what'd I tell you? The guy's totally picking on me.
Sprig: Why don't you just ask him why he's doing it? Tritonio says, "An honest dialogue is more powerful than any weapon."
Anne: Blech. That's the corniest thing I've ever heard--
(She lets go of the wall, only to fall screaming until she lands in a bush with a thud.)
Tritonio: Even your fall needs work, Anne.
(Anne sighs.)
(owl hoots)
Tritonio: Here, children, your quinoa macro bowls are ready. (looks around) Where is the gangly one? Does she not like quinoa?
Sprig: She said she wanted to be alone.
Tritonio: You must eat, Anne. Only a fool fights on an empty stomach.
Anne: Tritonio, can I ask you something? Why don't you like me?
Tritonio: What? I like you.
Anne: Oh, come on. You're always being super tough on me for no reason. Just like my teachers back home. Blech.
Tritonio: (laughs) Oh, Anne. If I seem tougher on you, it's not because I don't like you. It's because I see a girl who is not living up to her full potential.
Anne: Really?
Tritonio: Indeed. In you, I sense someone that, with a little effort could achieve greatness. And I am sure your teachers back home felt the same way.
(Anne smiles at Tritonio's words.)
Tritonio: And now, I believe you are ready for this. (takes out a sword)
Anne: Oh, wow!
(Tritonio hands the sword to Anne. She pulls it out of its scabbard, revealing a glowing blue blade.)
Tritonio: This blade has been in my family for many years, and now it is yours. Get some sleep, Anne, for tomorrow, the real training begins. (jumps off the tower) Way-ha-ho!
(Anne looks down at the sword, her face reflected on the blade. Then she smiles and sheathes the sword.)
(The next day, the kids are training, while Tritonio is sparring with Anne.)
Tritonio: Parry, swing! Imagine I'm a fearsome assassin. Or perhaps, a meddlesome train conductor.
Anne: (shouts) You're too fast.
Tritonio: Indeed. But when you find yourself outmatched, think outside the box.
(gasps)
(shouts)
(Anne grunts)
Tritonio: (laughs) Excellent! You've all improved so much. Especially you, Anne. (winks at her)
(Anne giggles)
Tritonio: Now, come. It is time for your final test.
(The group walks into another room.)
Tritonio: Tomorrow is our last day together. So I put together an exercise to test all the skills you've learned. I have rented a train, inside of which, I have hidden a fake priceless ruby. Also, I have hired actors to portray guards who will stop at nothing to keep the ruby safe. You must retrieve it using the wisdom and skills I have taught you. Now, study these plans. Become one with the plans. Eat the plans. (tears off a piece of the plan and eats it, his lips smacking. He then jumps away.) Eh, up! We leave at dawn!
Sprig: So does anyone else think this just looks like we're robbing a real train?
Polly: Yeah. Could Tritonio be using us?
(Anne slams her fists on the table, startling Sprig and making Polly scream.)
Anne: That's ridiculous! Tritonio's a good dude who believes in me. I think we should do it.
Sprig: Anne, you seem... oddly invested.
Polly: Yeah, where's old "teachers stink" Anne?
Anne: (dramatically) That Anne is dead and buried. (normally) Now come on, these plans ain't gonna study themselves.
Sprig: You got me convinced.
Polly: As long as I get to use my boom shrooms, I'm good.
(bell dinging)
(train horn blares)
Train Conductor: Huh? What the--
(horn blares)
(brakes squealing)
Sprig: Please, governor, I'm a poor orphan boy who done and twisted his wee ankle on these here train tracks.
Train Conductor: (sniffs) Poor kid. Guards! Help me!
Toad Guard 1: Another day, another wounded orphan to move.
(Anne and Polly laugh)
(squeals, snorts)
Toad Guard 2: This ankle isn't twisted.
Train Conductor: Hey! The train!
Toad Guards: Stop! Stop! No, no, no!
Train Conductor: Hey! Get back here!
(Sprig trips the conductor with his tongue, causing him to fall onto the guards.)
(Sprig laughs)
(Anne laughs)
Sprig: Acting is fun!
Train Conductor: I trusted you!
Sprig: Oh, my gosh!
(both grunting)
Train Conductor: Orphan!
Anne: Man, these guys are really good actors.
Polly: Never mind that. Let's get that ruby!
(rattling)
Anne: Polly, you're up.
(beeping, explosion booms)
(grunting, gasping)
Anne: There it is. We did it, guys. Big T is gonna be so proud of us.
Tritonio: Proud is an understatement!
(all gasp)
Sprig, Polly, & Anne: (together) Tritonio!
Tritonio: You've all done so well. Ah, here it is, the Tiger Moth's Eye. Now, I have one more question. What was the first lesson I taught you?
Anne: (gasps) Oh, oh! Trust no one!
Tritonio: Bingo.
-(door locks)
(Polly, Sprig gasp)
Anne: Tritonio, what are you doing?
Tritonio: Sorry, kids, but I never could've robbed this train by myself. And now that I have what I want, I'll be going. Give my regards to the guards! (laughs)
Anne: (grunts) I don't believe this. He double-crossed us. The first teacher I really clicked with ended up being a fake. Well, he's not getting away with this. Polly, got any more boom shrooms?
(weapons cocking)
Tritonio: Ah, they were good kids. Too bad they have to go to prison forever.
(beeping, explosion booms) (grunts)
Anne: Tritonio!
Tritonio: (laughs) I have to say, even I am impressed.
Anne: You really mean it-- Guys, now!
(both scream)
Sprig: Whoa! Whoa!
(Polly is ululating.)
Polly: Oh, hi, Sprig.
Sprig: (grunts) Oh, that hurt.
(beeping, explosions boom)
Tritonio: Come on.
(horn blaring)
(Anne screams, grunts)
Anne: Ah-- Huh?
(Tritonio kicks Anne in the face.)
Anne: Ooh! (panting, she stumbles backwards until she reaches the edge) Oh! (grunts)
Anne: Trusting you was a mistake, but you've made a huge mistake, too.
Tritonio: Oh, yes? And what is that?
Anne: You taught me how to fight.
Tritonio: Ah! Big T's eyes!
(both grunting)
(grunts)
Anne: School's out, teach.
Train Conductor: Thanks, kids. The tower's been trying to catch this slimeball for months. Been robbing trains with kids for quite some time now, the sicko.
Tritonio: You do have to respect my creativity.
Polly: We respect nothing!
Sprig: Yeah, get out of here, you fraud!
Tritonio: See you around, Anne. I wasn't kidding when I said you had potential. You certainly bested me.
Anne: Save it, you crook. I just have one more question for you. (pause for a bit) Was the goatee even real?
Tritonio: (picks out the goatee under his chin) What do you think?
(horn blows)
(all groan)
Sprig: Oof, you probably dislike teachers more than ever now, huh, Anne?
Anne: You know what? Tritonio might have been a crook, but he was onto something. When I get home, I'm gonna give my teachers another chance.
Polly: (monotone) Okay.
(horn beeps)
Hop Pop: Hey, kids.
Anne: How was the convention, HP?
Hop Pop: (slowly) Oh, fine. Didn't get swarmed by killer locusts, if that's what you mean. How was your weekend?
Anne: Good.
Sprig: We didn't rob a train.
Polly: Nope. No crimes committed.
Hop Pop: Good, good. Great to know we definitely didn't have two wacky adventures.
