Hop Pop: Hmm.
Sylvia: Been a long time since I've danced with someone. Might be nice to feel the embrace of a man.
Felicia: (Chuckles, slightly embarrassed.) Mom.
Hop Pop: (stammers) Huh? (Suddenly being poked on the shoulder and back by a blue frog's hand.) Huh? Ooh!
Monroe: Ha-ha! Classic, gullible Hopediah!
Hop Pop: (Unamused.) Oh. Hey, Monroe.
Anne: (Observes from the alley.) Who's that?
Sprig: That's Monroe. He and Hop Pop have been rivals forever.
Polly: Monroe wins at pretty much everything. Lawn bowling, shuffleboard, other old man activities.
Monroe: You're not seriously thinking of going to this thing, are you? Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself like last year's barn dance fiasco. (laughs) See you around, old-timer.
Hop Pop: Oh, we'll see about that, Monroe. We'll see. (whistle blowing) Huh?
Sprig: Hop Pop, it's the fuzz! Everyone scatter! Aah!
(punching sounds)
Hop Pop: Can't dance, huh? We'll see about that. Looks easy enough. Sorry, Sylvia. And a-one, and a-two and--
(He takes out a mop, which breaks when he tries to dance with it.)
(shouts)
(sighs)
Hop Pop: Looks like it's hopeless.
(bass pounding)
Hop Pop: What in tarnation?
(pop music playing)
Hop Pop: Anne can dance?
(Anne shouts in alarm when she sees him and her shoe flies off.)
Hop Pop: Aah! Ow!
Anne: Hop Pop, what the heck, dude?
Hop Pop: Anne, I need your help.
Anne: What?
(He shows her the Dance Fever poster.)
Hop Pop: That's why I'm begging you. Teach me your ways! I can't tell Sylvia how I feel, but maybe I can show her by dancing with her.
Anne: Huh. Never figured you for a hopeless romantic, Hop Pop. Let's do this thing.
Hop Pop: Hey, um, think we could keep this just between us?
Anne: You got it, HP. My lips are sealed.
Sprig: Whoo! Dance it up, Hop Pop!
Polly: Shake that booty!
Hop Pop: What happened to the zipped lips?
Anne: Couldn't help it. This is just too juicy! Besides, when I'm done with you, you and Sylvia will be locking lips by the end of the night.
Sprig: (groans)
Polly: Oh, come on!
Anne: Lesson one. Footwork.
(Anne starts showing some of her moves; Hop Pop tries to replicate, but trips and falls onto an ant hill.)
(upbeat music playing)
(shouts)
(music stops)
(shouts)
Hop Pop: It burns! It burns!
(screams)
Anne: Lesson two. Rhythm.
Anne: (taps rhythmically)
Hop Pop: (taps off-beat)
Hop Pop: Ow!
Anne: Lesson three. Freestyle. Freestyle is expressing yourself in your own unique way.
Polly (looking at Hop Pop): Huh?
(Hop Pop grunting)
Hop Pop: (caws) Ta-da! Whoo! I gotta say, that's the first lesson I actually felt good--
Anne: Hop Pop, if you wanna win over Sylvia...Never do freestyle again!
 Sylvia I'm gonna win your heart Babe 
 When you see my froggy booty On the dance floor 
 Sylvia, you're tugging At my heartstrings 
Hop Pop: Here we go.
 Taking it out On the dance floor, babe 
Sprig: Whoa! Yeah, Hop Pop!
Polly: Miracles happen!
Anne: Nice work, Hop Pop. Or maybe I should call you "Hip Pop?"
Hop Pop: That reference means nothing to me.
Sprig: Guys, there's only ten minutes till the dance. Come on!
Anne: Oh, we gotta go!
(dancers chattering)
(gulps)
Sprig: I gotta say, as long as you're not being forced to date someone, dances ain't half bad.
Hop Pop: (gulps) She's here! I feel like I'm gonna faint. Can frogs faint? I don't know anything anymore!
Anne: Hop Pop, calm down. You are the king of this dance floor! You walk right up to that lovely lady and ask her to dance.
Hop Pop: Hmm! I got this.
Anne: Get it!
Hop Pop: (clears throat) S-S-Sylvia? Uh...
Monroe (cutting in front of him): Sylvia Sundew! Would you do me the honor of this dance?
Anne: What?
Sprig and Polly: (gasp)
Sylvia: Why, Monroe. I'd be delighted.
Hop Pop: (gasping) Sylvia! Dance with me instead!
Sylvia: Well, Hopediah.
Monroe: Him? Ha! He can't dance.
Hop Pop: I can dance better than you. I've been trained by the best, and I'm gonna take you down!
Monroe: Is that so? Then let's settle this.
(applause)
Anne, Sprig, Polly: (gasp)
Sprig: The drama.
Anne: Come on, guys. Hop Pop's gonna need backup.
Villager: Look over there.
Villager: What's going on?
Woman: Hopediah?
Man: It's a standoff.
Toadstool: Oh! What's this? It appears two stallions have taken to the floor and are about to battle it out!
(rhythm builds)
Hop Pop: Slick. Here we go. Look out. Ha!
(He performs a decent dance routine.)
Villager: You know, that wasn't half bad.
Villager: Technically proficient.
(cheering)
Toadstool: A solid effort by Hopediah Plantar! But how will Monroe respond?
Monroe: (chuckles)
All: (gasp)
Anne: Oh, no.
Monroe: Hold tight, now. Watch me now.
(He performs an excellent dance routine.)
(loud cheering)
Toadstool: Well, looks like that's it for Hopediah. Unless he has something special or unique to show.
Sprig: Well, we did our best. And isn't that what counts?
Polly: (shouts) What kinda loser talk is that?
Anne: I honestly don't know what to do. Monroe's just a better dancer.
Hop Pop: Well, then I guess I'll just have to express myself in my own unique way.
Sprig: Wait, you don't think he's gonna...
Anne: (gasps) Oh, no. Hop Pop! Hop Pop!
Hop Pop: Sylvia, I don't think I'll ever be able to tell you how I feel about you. But I can show you. Hit it, boys!
Band player: Uh, yeah. We've been hitting it, but okay.
(Hop Pop begins doing freestyle.)
(sighs)
(caws)
(caws, gags)
Toadstool: Unbelievable!
(dancers gasp)
Toadstool: I ain't never seen moves like those. It's horrifying.
(hooting)
(screams)
Hop Pop: Ta-da!
All: (gasps)
Anne (face covered): Is it safe to look yet?
Sprig (face covered): No idea.
Polly (face covered): Couldn't tell you.
Monroe: Oho, yikes. Well, I think it's clear who the winner is.
Villager: It's Monroe.
Villager: Not even close.
Villager: Monroe does it again!
Monroe: Come along, Sylvia. No need to waste time with losers.
Hop Pop: Oh.
Polly, Sprig, Anne: (sigh)
Sylvia: Oh, Hopediah!
Hop Pop: Huh?
(Sylvia starts doing freestyle.)
(grunting, humming)
(gurgles)
All: Ooh!
Monroe: Wha--She's as freaky as he is! The horror!
(Hop Pop joins her.)
(croaking)
Woman: This is not for children's eyes!
Anne: Why? Why?
Toadstool: Okay! That's enough of that. Pack it up. Dance is over! Everyone go home!
(Hop Pop and Sylvia stop dancing, panting and laughing.)
Hop Pop: I don't get it. Why?
Sylvia: I have a soft spot for the weird ones, remember?
Hop Pop: (stammers) Ah, shame the dance is over. I could dance for hours with you.
(Sprig starts playing smooth violin.)
Hop Pop: Ahem, may I have this dance, Sylvia Sundew?
Sylvia: Why, yes you may, Hopediah Plantar.
Polly: May I have this dance, madame?
Anne: Thought you'd never ask.
