Whoa.
(rumbling) Huh?
Sprig, what did you do?
It wasn't him.
Mysterious earthquakes have been wreaking havoc on the city for weeks.
Water is being diverted, tunnels have become blocked,
sunlight has even seeped in.
Sunlight? No!
(sizzling) (groans)
Have you gone out to investigate the cause?
Or asked the surface dwellers for help?
We can't go above ground. We'll burn alive.
Plus, we don't associate with your kind if we can help it.
Indeed. Insularity is how we Olms survive.
Fewer friends, sure. But also fewer foes.
I am Parisia. What do you want, outsiders?
We've come to see Mother Olm.
Mother Olm? How do you know... (sniffs)
You two! I should have known you were involved.
For bringing outsiders here, you shall be punished severely.
You should be thanking them.
King Andrias is gonna destroy Amphibia
if we don't join together and stop him.
That's none of our concern.
We will thrive down here as we always have.
By keeping our snouts out of other species business.
- (rocks crashing) - (rumbling)
(Olms screaming)
It's probably that giant drill we saw.
Andrias must be mining for something.
Got to be iron ore.
Proteus is built on a huge deposit of it.
He must want it to build more war machines.
A giant drill? War machines?
(laughs) Preposterous.
These natural tremors are nothing more than common earthquakes.
- Makes sense to me. - Uh-huh.
But what about the sunlight? How do you explain that?
Silence! Guards, dispose of these outsiders.
What about us? Give us a second chance!
No second chances.
This is the Olm way.
And stay out.
(Lysil, Angwin sigh)
Hey. I know what it's like to make a huge mistake you regret.
I'm still fighting to make up for it.
And I hope you won't give up either.
(sighs) We'll try. Easier said than done.
(rumbling) (gasps)
The drill! (grunts)
It must be getting close to the city.
We have to do something! (grunts)
Come on. I know a shortcut to the surface.
Phew. You didn't say the shortcut was full of stank beetles.
Don't worry. You'll stop smelling in five days.
Or was it five years?
All right, team. Attack plan epsilon.
What about us? We want to help too.
The sunlight's too strong. Just wait here. We got this.
All right, Plantars. Let's go.
(computer) Reaching Proteus in ten, nine...
- This thing's on autopilot. - ...eight, seven...
- Everyone try to find a way - ...six...
to shut it down.
(alarm blares)
Oh, crud. It needs a password.
Any guesses?
Try 12345!
(alarm blares) Eh, worth a shot.
(computer) Five, four, three, two...
Ugh! We're out of time.
It sounds like they're in trouble.
We can't just sit here.
Finally something we agree on. Come on!
(sizzling) (both groan)
(both) For Proteus!
(sizzling) (both groaning)
Lysil, Angwin, what are you doing?
What we have to.
Angwin, you ready?
Ready!
(both screaming)
Hold fast, Lysil!
You too, Angwin.
It's coming down. Run!
(all screaming)
(all groaning)
Everyone okay?
Lysil? Angwin?
Oh, no.
(groaning)
Guys, are you okay?
I can't believe you dove into the drill like that.
It was the only way to save the city.
Proteus will always be our home.
Even if we don't live in it.
(sniffing)
Gonna be real hard to deny the existence of that drill now.
This doesn't prove anything.
(all) What?
How do I know
you didn't fake this?
Look at Lysil and Angwin.
They nearly killed themselves to protect you and your dumb city.
Did they? Maybe they injured themselves on purpose
to make it look like they protected us.
- Yeah. - That's right.
You two, get these outsiders out of our city.
Argh!
You are the biggest moron I have ever met!
(echoing) Excuse me?
Whoa. Sash, I don't think that's a good I...
I don't care anymore, Anne!
Lysil and Angwin bent over backwards
to prove they deserved a second chance.
But this snooty despot and her crummy town aren't worth it.
Come on, guys. If these idiots wanna perish in denial,
that's their business.
Let's get out of here.
Hmm.
Don't worry, you two.
If this city won't have you, Wartwood will.
- We will? - (Parisia) Not so fast!
You dare insult Parisia, the guardian of Proteus,
who has ruled over the city for thousands of years?
Impressive.
You've all got guts.
Especially the fur-clad one.
(all) Huh?
I haven't been yelled at like that
for about 500 years,
and it kinda shook me up.
I don't know what's going on topside,
but maybe it's better to be safe than sorry.
You shall meet Mother Olm.
Hang on. What about Lysil and Angwin?
Ugh. Fine.
They shall be granted access to the city.
- Yes! - Yay! - You won't be sorry!
Under constant supervision.
Boo. Oh, that's lame.
Oof. Oh, okay.
Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
Yes, yes. Don't make me regret it.
Now then, follow me.
