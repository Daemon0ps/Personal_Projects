(sighs) Okay. This is getting old.
Guess you might as well teach me your "special" toad tactics.
We actually do call them special toad tactics,
so sarcasm denied.
Dang it!
(grunting)
(straining)
(grunting)
Ah!
(grunting)
(grunts)
Ah!
I said tense your abs. Tense them!
(groans) This isn't working.
You think?
Your small frog body
is too frail for traditional toad conditioning.
Then maybe I don't need to fight like a dumb toad.
Say "dumb toad" again.
Dumb toa--
(yells, grunts)
That's it! I'm outta here.
I'll figure out how to beat Beatrix on my own!
No, you won't.
And now it won't be my fault when you get maimed.
How did I lose to that brat?
Take that! (grunts)
And that! And this!
Huh?
(slurps) Ah, it's honey.
(rumbling)
(growling)
(screams) Oh, crud!
I'm smack-dab in the middle of a hybeena nest!
-(hybeenas snarling) -(screams)
(yells)
-(grunts) -(hybeenas whimper)
Grime? How did you find me?
I heard your shrill, annoying yell from across the forest.
Hurtful, but okay.
(hybeenas growling)
(hybeenas whimpers)
That speed. It's actually impressive.
Oh!
(hybeenas snarling)
(groaning)
(yells)
Whoa! (grunts)
-(Grime grunting) -(hybeenas snarling, whimpering)
(both) Whoo!
(sighs) Good battle.
Yeah. We whooped their little bee booties.
I gotta say,
you pack a lot of speed and accuracy in that tiny body.
(chuckling) And you!
You took that hit and gave it back to them twofold.
How'd you do that?
Toads are trained from a very young age to let rage give you strength.
It funneled correctly, it can be a secret weapon!
Wow, that's pretty cool.
(bird cawing)
Maybe I could learn a thing or two from you.
Yes.
And I think maybe I've been training you all wrong.
Instead of molding you into the perfect toad,
I should be focusing on your strengths as a frog.
Speed, agility,
being annoying.
Well, Grimothy, wanna give this whole thing another shot?
Indeed.
But call me Grimothy again and I'll eat you alive.
(chuckles) Wow.
(rock music playing)
Uh...
Hmm.
(grunting)
Hachi machi! Ooh!
Grime! Are you okay?
Whoo!
You're ready.
(crowd cheering)
 Kickin' butt And takin' names 
 We're the school They call Saint James! 
You didn't even rewrite the song?
I'm very busy, Hop Pop!
Whoa!
(both grunt)
Here you go, bud. Looking intimidating.
What do you think, big guy? Do I have a chance here?
Realistically, no.
But you frogs always surprise me.
So, like, a 5% chance?
(crowd booing)
Don't worry, little frog. I'll make this quick.
We'll see who's quick.
-(bell rings) -Begin match!
(yells)
(grunting)
(overlapping grunting)
Can't dodge every hit!
All that speed, but no strength behind it.
This is why you don't stand a chance!
(distorted, yells) What the--
(Beatrix) I've never seen this before.
From frog or toad.
That's because it's frog and toad!
(yells)
(Beatrix grunting)
Impressive, but you forget one thing.
We toads love a good wrestle!
-(crowd gasps) -Sprig!
-(laughs) -(Sprig strains)
Looks like you've let everyone down, frog,
surprising no one.
(crowd gasping)
(Grime) Let rage give you strength.
If you funnel it correctly, it can be a secret weapon.
(groaning)
(groaning) What? What the--
(yells)
(Beatrix grunts)
(grunts)
(crowd gasps)
-Sprig wins! Sprig wins! -(bell rings)
(crowd cheers)
Whoo!
That was amazing, dude!
Well, I couldn't have done it without Grime's training.
Dang right.
(laughs)
No, I'm totally kidding.
-Great job, Sprig. -(Sprig laughs)
(Beatrix) Ahem!
I have to admit,
that frog-toad fighting style really was impressive.
Perhaps our armies united will be stronger as well.
Commander, I pledge my troops to fight for the resistance.
Wow! Who would've thought?
Frogs and toads on equal footing.
I know this undercuts the lesson,
but it's too good to pass up.
You got beat by a frog!
Beatrix lost to a frog.
A puny little-- (grunts)
Okay. See you when the war starts.
