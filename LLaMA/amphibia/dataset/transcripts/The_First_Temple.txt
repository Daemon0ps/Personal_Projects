Polly: (munching)
Anne: Who knew there was a bug that tastes just like chocolate? Why didn't anyone tell me sooner?
Polly: Hop Pop! You never let us have chocopede pancakes. What's going on?
Hop Pop: I thought you kids deserved a treat after, well...
Sprig: You lied and buried the music box, causing Anne to almost leave the family forever?
Anne & Polly: (gasp)
Hop Pop: (whimpers)
Sprig: Mm, boy am I glad Anne forgave you. Some people would carry the scars of that betrayal for life. Not you two, though. (laughs)
Polly: (elbows him) Sprig!
Sprig: What?
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm...I hope you like pancakes.
Anne: (chuckles)
Hop Pop: I-I-I made the batter from scratch, you know. Uh, been up since the crack of dawn, mixing.
Anne: Oh...great.
(bird shrieks)
Hop Pop: I'll get it!
Anne: Oh, thank frog.
(bird shrieks)
All: Huh?
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
Hop Pop: (screams) A monster bird, ridden by a pile of books! Wait, huh?
Marcy: (pops out of the book pile) Hiya, Plantar family!
All: Marcy!
Marcy: (falls) Aah!
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
Marcy: Big news, everyone. I finished my preparations for the--Whaa...Is this your house? Oh, it's so rustic and cute. When was it built? Third century? No. No, no, no. Second. Yes, of course. Okay, when it was af--
Anne: Hey, hey! Marbles. Big news?
Marcy: Oh, right. I finished my prep and we're ready for the first temple!
Anne: No way! Awesome!
Marcy: I just need to see the music box. Then it's go-time, gang. (She throws some punches.) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah-ya! (Sees everyone staring and stops.) Sorry, sorry. Long flight. A lot of pent-up energy. Anyway, music box.
Sprig: Good thing she didn't show up a few days ago, am I right?
Polly: You need to stop.
Anne: Here you go.
Marcy: (joints cracking) Okay, if my studies are correct, then...
(music playing, whirs)
All: Woah!
Marcy: There you go, bud.
Hop Pop: Oh, uh...(sighs) I better not.
Marcy: Hmm?
Anne: It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
Marcy: Well, we've got a big journey ahead. I'll explain everything on the way. Come on, Joe. Joe? (gasps) Joe Sparrow!
(cut to Joe Sparrow doing some funny moves to flirt with Bessie)
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
(Joe winks his eyebrows)
Bessie (blushes): (chirps)
Marcy: Leave that snail alone!
(Bessie leaves while still being blushed)
Marcy: Up you go!
Anne: Oop, pardon me. Pretty cramped up here, huh?
Hop Pop: Oh, uh, eh, so where do I sit?
Hop Pop: (screams)
Marcy: So, according to my research, these three ancient temple are filled with difficult challenges to keep out the unworthy. All we have to do is complete the challenges, and then we can charge the stone.
Anne: Nifty. So, what kind of challenges we talkin'?
Marcy: This first temple is said to specifically challenge your intelligence. So I'm pretty sure it's full of puzzles. No frog, toad or newt in history has been able to survive it.
All: Uh...
Marcy: But don't worry, because none of them were Marcy Wu, head of the chess club, master RTS player, straight-A student, except for gym but only because I was reading in class, which only proves my point!
Anne: That's all great, Marcy, but be careful. When you get this into something, you tend to tune everything else out.
(Flashback to where Marcy is playing a game reminiscent of Flappy Bird on her game console while pulling down a frozen yogurt lever.)
Marcy: Oh my gosh, Anne. I'm about to beat my all-time record!
(The camera pans to show the ice cream overflowing while Anne tries frantically to clean it up.)
Anne: I'm so happy for you!
(Cut to another scene, where Sasha, Anne, and Marcy are doing a school play. Anne is swinging from a rope while Marcy is playing with her game console backstage.)
Anne: Marcy! (screams) Let me down! Marcy! Help!
(The rope breaks causing Anne to fall into the audience.)
(Cut to Anne's room, where she is laying on her bed eating marshmallows while listening to the news.)
News Reporter: Breaking news, 500 snakes have escaped from--Wait, is that a middle school student?
(Camera pans to Marcy obliviously walking towards the snakes.)
Anne: Marcy! No!
(Flashback ends)
Anne: That was the worst Saturday of my life.
Marcy: That's called being in the zone, Anne. It's pretty much my superpower.
Anne: (sighs) Okay, okay. Just don't forget about us. This place is gonna be dangerous, and we're here to help.
Marcy: Oh, please! Like I could forget you guys. Penny? Sprout?
Polly: Polly.
Sprig: Sprig.
Marcy: Look, the point is, I'm not gonna let you guys down.
Hop Pop: You know, I wouldn't mind being let d--(screaming, grunting) I'm upside down.
Marcy: Welcome to Amygdala Woods, everyone, home to the first temple.
All: Whoa.
Hop Pop: Little help here?
Sprig: Whoa! What are these things?
Marcy: Gyromitra esculenta. Also known as brain mushrooms.
Anne: A forest full of brains for the intelligence temple? Kinda on the nose, don't you think?
Polly: Speaking of temples, I think you way overhyped this place.
Marcy: No, no, no. That's the temple.
All: (gasp)
(wind whistling)
Sprig: So what's this then? Outhouse. It's an outhouse.
(buzzing)
Marcy: All right, guys! Let's do this thing! (echoing)
Anne: Oop, sorry about that. After you, dude.
Hop Pop: Oh, no, no, no. A-After you, my dear.
Anne: (chuckles) Oh, don't be silly. I insist.
Marcy: Those two seem a bit off.
Hop Pop: No, I insist.
Marcy: Did something happen?
Sprig & Polly: Don't ask.
All: Wow.
Polly: Wow.
(clicks)
Polly: Uh-oh.
Marcy: Did I learn an entire dead language just for today? You better believe I did! Now, let's see. "Keeper of the box, one strong of mind, three trials await, that will return the stones' shine." Hey, looks like there's three trials, guys. And here we go.
(wind howling)
Sprig: A dead end. Well, we tried our best and that's what counts.
Marcy: Hey, come on. There's a puzzle here somewhere. Everyone, look for clues.
Anne: (chuckles) Hey, guess who found the puzzle? Whoa! Whoa!
Hop Pop: (gasps) Frog, help us. A cursed cube possessed by evil magic.
Marcy: No, it's the puzzle! Also, I'm pretty sure that's a magnetic field holding her up.
Hop Pop: Isn't that what I said?
Anne: Well, whatever it is, all yours, Marbles. (grunts, screams)
Marcy: Whoa, this thing's got, like, a zillion permutations. If this temple thinks it can beat me, it's got another thing coming.
All: (groan)
Polly: Uh...guys?
All: (grunt, screaming)
Sprig: Anyone else tasting chocopede pancakes right about now?
Anne: Marcy! Can you at least let us know what you're gonna move before you move it?
All: Whoa! (screaming)
Hop Pop: (screams)
Sprig: (screams)
Anne: Marcy!
Marcy: Ha! Got it!
All: (scream, groan)
Marcy: We did it! One down, two to go. (laughs) How fun is this? Yeah! (laughs) Whoo!
Polly: Wow, Anne, you weren't kidding about her being in the zone.
Hop Pop: Not to mention she's a tad overconfident.
Sprig: Hard to argue with the results though.
Anne: Ugh!
Anne: Oh, hey, a dance floor!
Marcy: Not quite. Watch.
Sprig: Woah. Not getting good vibes from this room.
Polly: Welp. Time to turn back. Thanks for playing, everyone!
Hop Pop: Hold on, gang. Look!
Marcy: "A dangerous room. What to do? Don't be jealous of my hue."
All: Huh?
Sprig: Who's Hue?
Marcy: Hmm. I wonder...
Anne: Okay, so pink is death by flame, blue is death by crushing. I'm still not following--Marcy!
Marcy: Doot doot doot doot dooot do!
All: (scream)
Marcy: (grunts)
Anne: (sighs)
Marcy: Ha! Solved it. Okay guys, listen up. Green is the safe color. Get it?
All: Eh...
Marcy: "Don't be jealous of my hue." It's a reference to green, the color of envy.
Sprig: Ah, yes, naturally.
Polly: Hmm...swell.
Hop Pop: I have a lot of green friends who would find that offensive.
Polly: But why hasn't the door opened then?
Marcy: Hmm. Looks like this is a two-person job. Someone go stand on the other green square.
Anne: Mar-Mar, are you...sure?
Sprig: Yeah, how do we know that one isn't some kind of trapdoor?
Polly: With spikes in it!
Hop Pop: Not helping, Polly.
Marcy: Guys, I've done the research. Plus, it's me, remember? I said I won't let you down and I meant it. Now, who wants to hit that button?
Anne: Hmm...
Anne & Hop Pop: I'll do it!
Hop Pop: Excuse me?
Anne: Huh?
Hop Pop: Anne, no. I'll do it. The whole point of this is to get you home alive. I've already had a good life.
Anne: No, Hop Pop. I'll step on the tile. This is my quest. It's my responsibility. Your responsibility is keeping your family safe, not me.
Sprig: Uh-oh.
Hop Pop: I care about you too, Anne.
Anne: I mean, to an extent, right? You kinda proved that when you buried the music box.
Hop Pop: Now, hold on. That's unfair.
Anne: Listen, Hop Pop, when push came to shove, you made a choice. It's fine. But let's stop pretending I'm part of the family, okay?
Hop Pop: Hmph. (croaks)
Marcy: Uh...everything okay over there? Can someone please hit the button?
Hop Pop: Gladly. And a-one and a-two--(screams)
Anne: (grunts)
Polly: Careful, girl!
Sprig: Anne!
All: (scream)
Anne: Whoa! (screams, chuckles, gasps)
Marcy: Whoo! What did I tell ya? This temple is toast! Consider the stone charged, baby! (hums)
Polly: Dang, girl!
Anne: I think I lost an eyebrow.
Polly: Cool!
Hop Pop: Hmph.
Marcy: (gasps) This leads to the top floor. That means there's only one puzzle left. Come on, team!
Hop Pop: Anne, I told you I was gonna step on that tile.
Anne: And I told you I didn't want you to.
Sprig: Hey, we kinda need to be a team in here so we don't die, so....
Hop Pop: I don't understand, Anne. I thought you forgave me.
Anne: Yeah? Well, maybe I spoke too soon.
Hop Pop: Spoke too soon?
Polly: What do we do, Marcy? This is fun to watch and all, but it could make the last puzzle pretty rough.
Marcy: I'm sure they'll work it out by the time we get there.
Hop Pop: Give me a break.
Polly & Sprig: Hmm...
(One hour later titlecard)
Hop Pop: So there's nothing I can do to fix this? Not one thing?
Anne: Nothing's coming to mind!
Sprig: Man, this is a long hallway. (grunts)
Marcy: Ha! Here we are. The final puzzle.
Anne & Hop Pop: (arguing)
Marcy: Oh! I'm so excited.
(arguing continues)
Marcy: Guys, killing the vibe. Thank you. Now, where was I? "Few have the brains to make it to this door, but are you wise enough to solve what's in store?" Yep! Let's go.
Hop Pop & Anne: Hmph.
Marcy: (gasps) I don't believe it! It's flipwart!
Anne: (gasps) What's flipwart?
Marcy: It's a strategy game I learned to play in Newtopia. It's like chess but to the max. I got so good at it, I even beat King Andrias.
Hop Pop: Impressive. They say King Andrias is one of the best flipwart players around.
Marcy: So, both sides have a wart, right? And they're trying to flip it! Each piece has a different set of abilities. These archers, for example, can only attack in a straight line. Oh, I love this game!
Hop Pop: Hmm. Hey, Marcy, what does this say?
Marcy: "Any commander whose wart falls may never set foot inside these temple walls." Looks like you only get one shot at this. One shot is all I need. But first, to set up the board...
Sprig: Well, I guess we'll just sit back quietly and watch.
Polly: Yeah, it'll be nice to sit this one out cause these flippas be tired. (screams)
All: Polly!
Marcy: A giant flipwart board?
Sprig: Polly, are you okay?
Polly: "Okay"? I've got a sword, baby! I'm doing better than all of you.
Anne: Marcy, do you think we should stop? This could get dangerous.
Marcy: We don't have a choice, Anne. You wanna get home, right? Then we've gotta play or we'll never recharge the stone.
Hop Pop: She has a point.
Anne: I didn't ask you, Hop Pop.
Marcy: Trust me, okay?
Anne: (sighs) Okay. I hope you know what you're doing.
Hop Pop & Sprig: (scream)
Hop Pop: Ooh, I get a scepter.
Polly: (chuckles) You're a pawn.
Sprig: Aw, man.
Marcy: Get ready, Anne. There's a good chance you're next.
Anne: Oh, looks like I'm not in the game. Well, you guys have fun, I guess. (screams)
Hop Pop: Wait, what?
Sprig: Anne, no!
Polly: Traitor!
Anne: No, this is good. I'll just play badly and sabotage the other team. Didn't think of that, did ya, temple? Ha! Here we go. Sabotage! (groans) Okay, I can't move.
Sprig: Anne? What's going on?
Hop Pop: Our hands are tied, literally.
All: (straining)
Marcy: Don't worry, everyone. I'll just play well enough so that none of you gets hurt. It'll be like hard mode! (chuckles) Fun!
Sprig: You wouldn't be saying that if you were the pawn.
Marcy: Okay, white goes first, so it's our move. Let's flip this wart!
Sprig: You got this, bud.
Marcy: Now, let's see how they respond.
Anne: Pfft!
Sprig: I don't like this game!
Marcy: (scoffs) Such a basic response. This is gonna be easy.
All: (gasp)
Polly: (laughs)
Sprig: Whoa! Phew.
Anne: (grunts)
Polly: (screams)
All: (panting)
Marcy: Gotta admit, this temple's good, but not good enough. Gotcha! We win!
Wart: (chuckles, taunts)
Marcy: Huh?? What? No! Guys, this thing cheats!
All: (gasp)
Anne: Hop Pop, look out!
Hop Pop: Huh? (screams)
Anne: (grunts, straining)
Hop Pop: (grunting) Man, what a day.
Sprig: Hop Pop! Marcy, do something!
Marcy: All right, so what if it cheats? Still not enough to beat me.
Hop Pop: (screams)
(thuds)
Marcy: I still have way more pieces. If I can just attack from a different angle, I should be fine. (nervous chuckle)
Hop Pop: (screams, grunts) Oh, I bet you're loving this, ain't ya?
Anne: What? No! I might be mad at you, but I don't wanna hurt you!
Hop Pop: Well, you're already hurtin' me. Every time you remind me of the mistakes I made, every time you rub it in my face that I let you down. I mean, what's it gonna take for you to let this go?
Anne: Hop Pop, I... I...
Hop Pop: Just tell me and I'll do it. Anything!
Anne: I don't know!
Marcy: Huh?
Anne: I just need time. Look, I want things to go back to the way they were. But--but-- (sobs)
Hop Pop: I'm sorry, Anne. You take all the time you need. Maybe it's enough to admit we still got issues, instead of pretending they don't exist.
Anne: (sniffs) I think that'd be good. I'd hug you except, you know, magical restraints.
Sprig: (sobbing) He had a family! He had a family!
Polly: (screaming)
Marcy: What am I doing?
Anne: No, no, no, no, no!
Hop Pop: (screams)
Marcy: No! Hop Pop, Anne! Who cares about this stupid game? I forfeit! (grunts) It's not working! Maybe I have to flip the big wart too. (grunts)
(alarm blaring)
Marcy: (grunts, screams)
Sprig: What the heck's going on?
Marcy: I'm trying to throw this game, but it won't let me! I need your help.
Sprig: Help you? How? (screams)
Marcy: (grunts)
Sprig: (screaming, grunts)
Wart: (squeals)
Marcy: (panting, groans)
Anne: Whoa!
Sprig: (coughs)
Anne: (coughs)
Polly: Ow.
Anne: Marcy? Marcy, I don't understand.
Hop Pop: Yeah, why'd you throw the game?
Marcy: Because it wasn't worth you guys getting hurt. I got so caught up in proving I was smart enough to win, I couldn't see what I was about to lose.
Sprig: Well, in your defense, that game was a ding dang cheat!
Polly: Yeah! I still think you're pretty smart. A little obsessive, though.
Marcy: Thanks, Sprig, Polly.
(the temple then shows the exit sign)
Marcy: I got it, temple. I wasn't smart enough to win, but I can find the exit, okay?
Hop Pop: (groans)
Anne: Need a ride, old-timer?
Hop Pop: I'm not that old. But, yes, thank you.
Anne: Guess we won't be charging the stone today, huh?
Marcy: No. And since I lost, I'm not allowed back in the temple. You guys will have to try it all again without me.
Anne: We'll manage, dude. Somehow.
Polly: Hey, guys. The failure arrow wants us to keep going this way.
Marcy: (sighs) Well, if we're gonna lose, might as well lose all the way.
Sprig: What? The outhouse?
Marcy: Wait a second.
All: (gasp)
Polly: What's that?
Marcy: No. It can't be. Guys, this is where we charge the stone!
All: Huh?
Hop Pop: But we failed! Uh, I wouldn't recommend touching that.
All: (gasp)
Marcy: "Only the worthy will have the wisdom to choose whether it's more important to win, or have the humility to lose. A choice was made to save thy friends and, honestly, doesn't that make you a winner in the end?"
Anne: That last bit was oddly casual!
Marcy: Of course! Why didn't I think of it sooner? The temple wasn't just testing for intelligence. It was also testing for humility!
Polly: Well don't give the temple a chance to change it's mind. Charge that bad boy!
All: (gasp)
Anne: We did it?
Marcy: We did it!
All: Yay! (screaming)
Marcy: Guys, it's leading us to the next temple!
Anne: That's good.
Hop Pop: Thank goodness.
Sprig: Thank frog!
Marcy: I should be able to triangulate its location with a bit of work. (inhales) Whoo! This just keeps getting better!
Anne: All right! One down, two to go! Ow!
Hop Pop: Oh, Anne, uh, whoops, I, uh--
Anne: Hop Pop, it's totally fine. It hurt, but I know you didn't mean to, and I want you to know that I'm really not mad about it.
Hop Pop: Well, thank you, Anne. And I want you to know that I will make an effort to be more careful about where I walk because--
Sprig: Hey, uh, can we leave now?
Polly: Yeah, this is uncomfortable to watch.
Anne & Hop Pop: We're working on it!
Marcy: Hey, you guys wanna go straight to the next temple tonight, or take a break first?
All: Break, please.
Marcy: Fair enough.
Yunan: The political situation is worsening, Your Highness. What started as a small valley riot is quickly becoming something more. Not only that, the toad lords have agreed to meet. This could spell disaster.
Andrias: How disappointing.
Yunan: And the traitor, Grime, is still at large and is currently being aided by a--aah!
Andrias: (laughs) Why, it's a message from Marcy. Looks like they're making progress. That's enough for now, Yunan. I'll handle the rest.
Yunan: Sire?
