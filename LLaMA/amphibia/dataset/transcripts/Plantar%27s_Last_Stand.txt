(The next day)
(groans, belches)
Hop Pop: Friends and frog folk, step right up. New limited edition Plantar's Potion. Only 20 coppers a bottle!
Anne: Twenty coppers? No one's gonna buy that--
Crowd: (roars)
Hop Pop: Thank you for your patronage.
Villager: I'm gonna feed this to my baby.
Anne: (groans) Well, did we make it? Did we save the stand?
Hop Pop: Just about. We gotta sell to one more sucker and we'll be home free.
Mrs. Croaker: I'll take a bottle, Hopadiah.
Hop Pop: (gasps) Sadie Croaker, the stand's oldest and most loyal customer.
Mrs. Croaker: Usually, I find potions and the like to be a bunch of malarkey, but if Hopadiah Plantar says it works, then it must.
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm.
Mrs. Croaker: Been saving this gold farthing for a while now. Waiting for something special to spend it on. One bottle, please.
Hop Pop: Uh... we're all sold out.
Polly: No, we're not!
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, thank you, deary.
Hop Pop: (stammers)
Mr. Croaker: To Hop Pop and the Plantars, the most honest folks in the business.
Anne: (winces and holds her chest) Oof, even I felt that one.
All: To the Plantars!
Hop Pop: No! (Slaps the potion out of Mrs. Croaker's hand.)
Mrs. Croaker: What has gotten into you, Hopediah?
Hop Pop: That was no health potion! It's garbage! (His voice echoes.) Folks, I'm so sorry. I never meant any harm. All I was trying to do was save my stand.
Hop Pop: Huh?
Sprig and Polly: (scream)
Polly: Hop Pop!
Sprig: They want the garbage potion!
(crowd screaming)
Wally: Eaten by flies? Oh, the irony!
Anne: Hey, let go of my bumpkin frog family!
(screams)
Hop Pop: Hey! Ain't this what you want?
(all scream)
Hop Pop: You really want this so bad? Then drop the kids and go get it!
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Oh! (sighs) Everyone okay?
Sprig: Not really.
Hop Pop: Kids, I messed up big. I was so desperate to save the stand, I forgot what the stand was even about.
Anne: So, what now?
Hop Pop: We go make things right. That's the Plantar way.
Hop Pop: Apologies.
Frog: (scoffs)
Hop Pop: Here you go, sir. I hope you'll give Plantar's another chance, someday.
Anne: I know things are bad, Hop Pop, but if it makes you feel any better, you were a crazy good salesman.
Hop Pop: (laughs) I was good, wasn't I?
Mrs. Croaker: Well, Hopadiah, looks like you're going to have to earn our trust back. That being said, I think your father would be proud that you did the right thing today.
Hop Pop: Thanks, Sadie. I'll work hard to earn your trust back.
Toadie: Not at this stand, you won't! No coin, no stand. Time to clear out!
Sprig: Don't worry, Hop Pop. We'll help you get the stand back.
Polly: You want me to...(clicks tongue) off Toadie? I'll do it. You know I will.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. Let's just get home and relax a little. You know, maybe the end of one tradition means the start of another. Maybe I ought to start over the Hop Pop way, experiment with those new seed varieties I always wanted to try.
Anne: That's the spirit, Hop Pop.
Sprig: Yeah, we're gonna make it after all.
(all laugh)
Polly: The future is ours.
Hop Pop: Oh, frog! I'm unemployed!
