(Upbeat music plays as we get a view of the citizens of Wartwood are gathered in front of a stage)
Marcy: Hey Sash.
Sasha: Hey.
Mayor Toadstool: Simmer down, everyone. Simmer down. Ahem. Now I know we've all been a little on edge since Sasha and Captain Grime came to Wartwood.
Sasha: What? Why? 'Cause we invaded the town?
Grime: Yeah, it was just one time
Mayor Toadstool: Point is, we could all use some levity. So let's consult the Wheel of Fun.
(All cheer)
Random Citizen: Oh, my frog. It's the wheel of fun.
(Toadstool spins the Wheel of Fun)
Soggy Joe: Come on, Massage Train.
(Wheel of Fun lands on Battle of the Bands)
Soggy Joe: Aw.
Mayor Toadstool: All right, everyone. Get your teams together and start rehearsing. Wartwood is having a Battle of the Bands.
Anne: You guys think Wartwood is ready for a "Sasha and the Sharps" reunion?
Sprig: The what and the who?
Marcy: It was a garage band the three of us had back home.
Sasha: We used to slay at talent shows.
(The screen zooms in on Sasha as fire builds up in the background.)
Hop Pop: Why is everything you say so aggro?
Wally: Hopidiah, Sprig, wanna join me and Loggle's jug band?
Hop Pop: You Kidding?
Sprig: Do we ever!
Anne: Come on, ladies. We can practice in my room.
Sasha: Hey Grime-sy. I'm gonna go rehearse with the girls. You all right going solo?
(The screen zooms in on Grime as the background goes black.)
Grime: Oh yes. All shall tremble at my performance.
(Grime then skips away happy, and giggling.)
Toadie: All right sir, I'm ready for rehearsal.
Mayor Toadstool: Are you kidding me, Toadie? I just bought myself a 12-hour nap. Why don't you take a little time for yourself?
Toadie: T-t-time for myself?
(Cut to the Planters house, Anne, Marcy, and Sasha are practicing in Anne's room.)
Anne: What you got there, Sash?
Sasha: A dope axe-beetle from Toad Tower. Check this out.
(Sasha pulls out a pink gem and inserts it into a slot in the axe-beetle. She strums the axe-beetle sending out a wave of pink energy. Marcy starts playing on the drums, and Anne starts playing her guitar. They all start playing "rock music" together. Marcy looses her grip on her sticks they fly across the room knocking Sasha to the ground. All of them start laughing.)
Anne: Sasha and the Sharps are back, baby!
Marcy: So, what song should we play at the battle?
Sasha: We should definitely play my song "Heart Stomper." It was always a hit back home.
Marcy: Oh! I'm into that. Anne? Anne?
Anne: Ahem. Actually I wrote a song about Amphibia and I was hoping we could play it.
Marcy: You didn't tell me you were writing a song. Let's do it. I mean, if that's okay with you, Sasha?
Sasha: (With an annoyed expression on her face) For sure. Teach it to us, Anne.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
All Girls Singing: Riding snails, But it's no big deal. (Marcy) Eating flies. (All Girls) But it's no big deal. (Anne) Finally me, and it's no big deal.
Anne: And here's where Sasha plays a killer guitar solo. We sing the refrain one more time, and then we're done.
Marcy: Nice work, Anna-Banana. Fun to play too.
Anne: Sasha, what do you think?
Sasha: It's good. I just have a few tiny notes that I think could make it even better.
Anne: Oh, okay.
Sasha: Great, these lyrics are all over the place totally. They'll have to change. Uh, are these bug suits? Oh, no, no, no. Mar-mar, the drumming is a little to dense. Let's strip some of these down. And you, we definitely need more lights. (Dumps mushrooms on Polly until she's buried) Frobo, too much fog, yet not enough fog. You feel me? Boom! Fixed it.
Marcy: It does seem simpler.
Anne: Yeah these are solid ideas. But, it's just not my song anymore. The lyrics are different, the melody is different. It's just different.
Sasha: That's called collaboration, Anne.
Anne: This isn't collaboration, it's a hostile takeover. Why do things always have to be your way?
Sasha: (sighs) So now, once again, I'm forcing you to do things my way. You know what, maybe I should just leave and join a different band.
Marcy: What?
Anne: No, Sasha! it'll be more fun if you're here with us.
Sasha: Listen if I leave, you guys can have all the fun you want. I can have all the control I want. And we can all get what we want.
Anne: Well, I guess that makes sense.
Sasha: Don't worry. I'll still be rooting for you guys. This is just how I go sometimes. I'll see you tonight.
Anne: So much for Sasha and the Sharps. Who's gonna do the guitar solo now?
Marcy: I'm sure we'll be fine. Probably.
(Both girls sigh heavily.)
Polly: You guys done moping? 'Cause Frobes and I charge by the hour.
(Sasha walks over to Felicia's Tea Shop. She knocks on the guest room door where Grime is practicing his act.)
Grime: Who is it? What do you want?
Sasha: Grime-sy! How would you like to be in a band with me?
Grime: Yeah, no. I'm a solo act.
Sasha: What the heck's wrong with you? You know this isn't a real battle, right?
Grime: Be that as it may, I still intend to win. Look behind you.
(Sasha looks over her shoulder.)
Sasha: Huh?
(Grime shoves her away from the door.)
Grime: Ha-ha!
(Sasha leaves the tea shop and sits down near the town statue.)
Sasha: Looks like I'm a solo act, unless I can find someone who wants to do everything I say.
(On the other side of the statue, Toadie sighs.)
Toadie: Mayor's napping. Everyone is already in a band. Who am I supposed to play music with that will also boss me around?
(Toadie plays a sad note. Sasha approaches him.)
Sasha: You, tiny sad frog. You're coming with me.
(In the forest, Sasha and Toadie are playing "Heart Stomper.")
Sasha Singing: I'm a heart stomper! Stompin' on hearts! If you wanna get away, you're gonna need a head start!
Sasha: Take it, Toadie!
(Toadie starts playing his drum.)
Sasha: Yes! Play that drum! Blow the horn!
(Toadie starts to play his horn.)
Sasha: Now, strike the final pose!
(Sasha and Toadie pose, and the song ends. Toadie falls to the ground, panting.)
Sasha: Not bad. What if the bridge was an F-sharp instead of C-sharp?
Toadie: Love it!
Sasha: Oh, and maybe at the end, we could do the splits.
Toadie: No problem!
Sasha: (in a sarcastic tone) And how about we shoot you out of a cannon?
Toadie: Totally here for it.
Sasha: Come on, don't just agree with everything I say. What's your actual opinion?
Toadie: (sits up) Oh, I stopped having opinions years ago. I'm just 100% here to support you.
Sasha: What? How do you even live like that? I have opinions about everything. And if I'm not in control at all times, I'll go crazy. It's actually kind of exhausting.
Toadie: Well, maybe you should try letting go a little. Let someone else take the reins. Pass the baton. Hand over the keys-
Sasha: Thanks, I get it.
Toadie: My point is, most people don't realize just how fun it can be to support someone you really care about.
Sasha: Huh. Well, thanks for that perspective, you weird, little butler frog. Now, come on. We've got a lot of practicing to do if we're gonna win. A one, and a two, and a 20 times through!
Toadie: This is gonna hurt!
(Toadie and Sasha continue to play "rock music." The scene cuts to Wartwood town square, where a stage is set up.)
Mayor Toadstool: Welcome, everyone, to the Battle of the Bands. Goose-lily and I will be your judges for this evening. So, what do you say we get things started?
Duckweed: My name is Duckweed.
Mayor Toadstool: Don't sass me Goose-lily. Hit the lights!
Polly: You got it!
(Chuck walks onstage with two huge tulips.)
Chuck: Ahem.
(The tulips start to melodically moan.)
Chuck: I grow singin' tulips.
Mayor Toadstool: Oh, this is gonna be a long night.
(Toadstool holds up a sign that rates Chuck's act 4. Duckweed rates it a 5. Cut to the next act where Mrs. Croaker is warbling like a theremin. Toadstool rates Mrs. Croaker's act a 2, a confused expression on his face. Duckweed clearly loves it, and rates her act a 10. The scene cuts to the next act, where Loggle, Hop Pop, Wally, and Sprig are all playing country music. During their act, Loggle falls off of his rocking chair.)
Loggle: Whoa, Whoa!
(Toadstool rates their act at a 6. Duckweed gives it a 5.5. Hop Pop, Sprig, Wally, and Loggle leave the stage.)
Hop Pop: That's good enough for me!
Sprig: Mediocrity is comforting.
(Anne and Marcy approach Sasha.)
Anne: Hey, Sasha!
Sasha: Oh, hey guys, those costumes are... something else.
Anne: I'm a Drag-Anne-Fly!
Marcy: And I'm the personification of metamorphosis!
Sasha: Cool. Well, have fun out there.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
Marcy: Yeah, you too.
Toadie: Hey, should we be worried about them?
Sasha: Nah, I've seen their performance, and it's all right. But nowhere near as good as it could've been with me in control. I just wanted all of us to succeed. I was just being a good friend. Why couldn't they see that?
Toadie: I know the feeling. But no matter how badly you want someone to succeed, you can't force it. Because sometimes being a good friend just means being there for them when they need it the most.
Mayor Toadstool: Ladies and gentlefrogs, I give you, The Sharps!
(Crowd cheers. Anne starts playing the guitar. Marcy starts playing the drums.)
Anne, Marcy Singing: (Anne) Took a leap through a box, super weird, to a swamp where frogs talk (Marcy) Oh,oh (Anne) Now I'm stuck, got no plans, just my luck, I'll do the best that I can (Marcy) Whoa, oh (Anne) Making friends and enemies, it's weird, but hey, it's grown on me! (Anne and Marcy) Bugs frogs, newts, and toads, gonna be a bumpy road. Flies for snacks, worms for lunch, I think I actually love this swamp! It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! Find a way to start again, brush off the dirt and make some friends! It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! I feel at home in a place that shouldn't be real! Crazy strange, but it's no big deal!
(Anne and Marcy continue singing and playing their instruments. From backstage, Sasha smiles from seeing them enjoy themselves.)
Mayor Toadstool: Well, it's certainly charming. I just hope there's a very cool guitar solo about to drop.
Anne: Here goes.
(Sasha comes onstage and starts playing an impressive solo with her axe-beetle. Anne and Marcy look surprised and happy.)
All Three Girls Singing: Ohhhhhh It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! I feel at home in a place that shouldn't be real! (Anne) Killer birds, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Sasha) Riding snails, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Marcy) Eating flies, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Anne) Finally me, and it's no big deal!
(Song ends. Crowd cheers. Both Toadstool and Duckweed give their act an 8.)
Anne: Sasha, that was awesome. I'm so psyched you joined us.
Sasha: Me too! Sorry it took so long.
(Toadie whispers something in Mayor Toadstool's ear.)
Mayor Toadstool: I've just been informed that the next act has been canceled. So give it up for your final contestant, Grimetime!
(Grime enters the stage, laughing maniacally.)
Polly (switches the spotlights to Grime): Aw, heck yeah!
(He has an ominous-looking statue with him. He opens it, and it's revealed to be a harp. The crowd gasps.)
Grime: Ahem. This piece is dedicated to the serenity of nature.
(Grime plays his harp beautifully and continues to do so)
Anne (in awe along with Sasha and Marcy): WOAH!
(3 hours later, by the end of his act, the whole crowd, including Anne, Marcy, and Sasha, are crying.)
Mayor Toadstool: Well, I've seen enough. Grime wins!
(Mayor Toadstool and Duckweed both rate his performance with a 10/10.)
Grime: (laughs) Yes! Yes!
Marcy: Sorry we lost, Sash.
Sasha: You know, as much as it pains me to lose, it was worth it have so much fun with you guys up there.
Mayor Toadstool: Alright, folks, gather round. I got one more announcement. Now, as I understand, you three girls will be leaving us soon?
Anne: Yup. With the box charged, we'll be heading to Newtopia tomorrow for the king to send us home. Everyone, you've all done so much for me, and I'll miss you more than you could ever know.
Mrs. Croaker: Aw, shucks.
Anne: Hey, before I go, can we take a group photo?
Mayor Toadstool: Heck, yeah! Everybody, line up!
(Cut to everyone around the town statue, ready to take a picture. Sprig is setting up Anne's phone for it.)
Anne: Sprig, come on! Hurry, hurry!
(Photo is taken.)
