Bartley: I'm telling you, Branson, what we need is a direct frontal assault.
Branson: And I'm telling you, Bartley, a sneak attack is what's called for.
Blair: Yeah, well, you're both wrong. We need to learn how to communicate with our ant brethren and live in sweet, sweet harmony.
Ludicrous!
Yeah, shut up, Blair.
Blair: You shut up!
(The three start arguing; Marcy enters the tent.)
Marcy: 'Sup, triple B?
Ahem. Ah, Master Marcy. (To the Plantars) Are you lost?
Marcy: No, no. They're with me. The Plantars traveled here all the way from the valley.
(Sprig and Hop Pop each eat a fly while Polly hops onto the table and lets out a massive burp.)
Ah, welcome, dirty peasants.
Marcy: (gestures to her smiling friend) And this is my friend, Anne... (Anne pokes her cheek, which she holds.) Ow.
Anne: (laughs) Sorry. Just... still can't believe you're here. (She starts playfully patting Marcy's head like a drum.)
Marcy: (giggles) Anne, quit it.
Anne: All right, all right. Keep doing what you're doing.
You'll be glad to hear we've agreed on a battle strategy.
What? We've agreed on nothing!
Marcy: Well, no worries. I think I got it figured out. Anne, do you remember when we studied insect migration patterns in biology class?
Anne: Nope.
Marcy: Well, since the weather warmed up, those ants have been sending scouting parties deeper into our territory. In fact, I predict a full-scale invasion is just around the corner.
(As Marcy goes on, Anne gets distracted playing with the hood of Marcy's cloak.)
Marcy: The king has asked me to stop them before they turn Newtopia into a giant anthill. (To prove her point, she crushes the model of the cuty with a model of what said anthill will look like.)
Sprig: Wait. You work directly for the king of Amphibia?
Marcy: Uh-huh.
Hop Pop: Sprig, behave yourself.
Anne: I didn't even know you guys had a king.
Hop Pop: Well, duh. We're not anarchists, Anne.
Polly: Speak for yourself.
Marcy: Okay. Plan is we're gonna sneak behind enemy lines and drive the ant queen away. With her gone, the rest should retreat.
Sprig: Oh, yeah? And how are we doing that?
Marcy: Check it out!
Polly: (gasps) Boom shrooms?
Marcy: Not quite. These are stink shrooms!
Polly: (disappointed) Oh. Carry on.
Marcy: They're designed to release pheromones that should drive the queen away instantly. But we will have to fight our way through a bloodthirsty hoard of ants.
Polly: My interest has been restored.
Marcy: We'll have to be extra careful. If one thing goes wrong... (In leaning on the table, she nearly topples it) Whoa! (chuckles) Flimsy table.
Anne: Uh, Marbles, this sounds pretty dangerous. Yeah, why don't you leave the mission to me and the Plantars? We did stuff like this all the time in the valley. (grunts)
(Anne and the Plantars strike a pose.)
Hop Pop: To the max!
Marcy: Ugh. Come on, Anna Banana. I'll be fine.
Sprig: Banana?
Marcy: I've changed, remember?
Anne: Mm-hmm. Your cape's on fire again.
(Sure enough, it is. Marcy screams.)
Triple B: Fire! Fire! Fire! Somebody do something!
Anne: Hold still. (She removes the cape.) There! (Once it's on the ground, she stomps it out.)
Hop Pop: Those capes sure are flammable.
Marcy: Anne, trust me. I can handle this. Now let's get going. Mission, engage!
(Marcy runs off. Anne sighs then follows.)
Polly: What's your problem?
Hop Pop: Me? Well, to be honest, my cholesterol's been a little...
Polly: Not you. Frownzilla over there.
Sprig: Oh, come on, guys. Surely you don't trust this "Marcy" person.
Hop Pop: I do.
Polly: With my life, actually.
Hop Pop: I mean, look, Sprig, she's clearly harmless.
(He points outside where Marcy is studying her journal surrounded by butterflies. She notices them and giggles.)
Sprig: All right, yes, on the surface she looks harmless, but do you not remember Sasha?
Hop Pop: Eh, I try not to.
Polly: Now that you mention it...
Sprig: Well, I say we watch "Marbles" like a pigeon hawk. That way we can be ready if she tries to pull anything funny. You guys with me?
Polly: Still no.
Hop Pop: Can't say I agree, but you do your thing.
Sprig: (groans) Fine. Thanks for nothin'.
Hop Pop: You guys coming?
What, us?
(chuckles) Of course not. We're analysts.
We don't do... (snorts) ...field work.
Hop Pop: And what's wrong with field work? I'll have you know we farmers are the backbone of society! (ribbits)
Weirdos.
Marcy: Okay, we should be arriving there shortly! (screams)
Anne: Marcy!
Hop Pop: Well, down the hatch!
Sprig: All right, Bessie, we're about to be betrayed... probably. If we're not back in three hours, send for help.
(Bessie neighs and nibbles his head.)
Sprig: Good girl.
(Marcy grunts)
Marcy: All right! Let's go.
Anne: Hold up. Stay behind me.
Sprig: Behind, eh? Just where a maybe-backstabber would wanna be.
Anne: Okay, if we can just stay in this formation- Wait!
Marcy: This is gonna be a cinch, guys. Trust me, I know these tunnels better than anyone... (Screams as she falls down a hole: Anne catches her by the cape and pulls her up. chuckles and gives a thumbs-up) Thanks. Okay. Note to self: Do not step in holes.
Anne: Seriously, let us handle this. You'll be safer in the back.
Sprig: I gotta say, I do feel pretty safe back here. (grunts)
Everyone: Sprig!
Sprig: Why me? Ow! Why always me? (screams)
(ants shrieking)
Anne: All right, guys. Fight mode!
Hop Pop/Polly: On it!
Sprig: Yeah, on it!
Polly: Oh, Sprig, good. You survived.
Sprig: Yeah, I kicked him!
Anne: Okay, Marcy, stay close. (She sees Marcy wander off and blows a raspberry.)
Marcy: Ooh! Nice.
Anne: (grunts) Marcy, what are you doing?
Marcy: (chuckles) Essence of Heron's bane. Just what the doctor ordered.
(grunting)
Marcy: Steady, steady.
(screaming)
Marcy: Done! Guys, this way! (grunts) Come on! Insta-vines! Bred 'em myself.
Polly: Uh, guys? A little help here.
Marcy: Whoopsies!
Anne, Sprig, and Hop Pop: (gasp) Not the baby!
(grunting)
(grunts)
(roars)
Sprig: See? That could've been on purpose.
Polly: It was an honest mistake, Sprig.
Anne: Marcy!
Marcy: Oh, sorry, sorry. But it all turned out okay, right? Anyway, isn't vegetation in Amphibia just the coolest?
Hop Pop: You think vegetables are cool? Marcy, how'd you like to be adopted?
Sprig: Hmm.
Polly: Dude, seriously, chill.
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah, I got lots of vegetables back home.
Marcy: Wait. Shh! Get down! (the queen growls) It's the queen.
(spits, roars)
(purrs)
Sprig: Well, at least she's a good mother.
Marcy: Here's the plan. We're going to have to plant these around the room. That way she gets a nose-full. They're set to go off in five minutes, so move quickly. Also, the queen is nearly blind, but hears really well. So be very, very quiet.
(all grunt)
(crackling)
Anne: (gasps)
Marcy: (looks up) Huh? (grunts as Anne pushes her out of the way)
(queen growling)
(exhales)
Marcy: Anne, what are you doing?
Anne: Um, saving you from a giant rock that was about to crush you?
Marcy: Well, you didn't have to. I was about to get out of the way, myself.
Anne: No, you weren't. I have to protect you. Like I always do. Just like back home.
Marcy: But we're not back home, Anne. And I've been doing just fine by myself.
Anne: Yeah, but, but...
(crackling)
(squeaking)
Sprig: You gotta be kidding me.
(grunting)
(screaming)
(roars)
(roaring)
Anne/Hop Pop/Polly: Sprig!
Marcy: He's still alive! These bugs take a while to digest their food. Look!
(roars)
(gurgling)
Marcy: I can still save him.
Anne: No! I'll do it. You just... stay here.
Marcy: Anne, only I've studied barbari-ant biology. It has to be me.
Anne: No, it doesn't! I can handle it.
Marcy: Ugh! Why won't you just let me go?
Anne: (starting to cry, yells) Because I just got you back, okay? (Marcy looks surprised.) And I don't... (sniffs) I don't wanna lose you again.
(Marcy's look softens into a gentle smile: she grabs Anne's hands.)
Marcy: You won't. I promise.
Anne: (snorts) Okay... go. You got this.
Marcy: See you on the other side.
(ants shrieking)
Hop Pop: Who knew these ants were so bouncy?
Marcy: I did, 'cause I studied them.
Hop Pop: I can't watch.
Polly: Dibs on the crossbow.
Anne: Come on... Come on...
(Marcy punching, grunting)
(The Ant Queen vomits, and Marcy flies out sailing on a bone, carrying Sprig under her arm. Sprig looks up at Marcy, (whose eyes briefly flash green) and winks at him.)
Sprig: (whispers) Trustworthy. Whoo-hoo!
(all cheering)
Anne: She did it!
(Marcy screams)
Hop Pop, Polly: (screaming) Oh, no! I gotcha! I gotcha!
(all grunt)
(roars)
(gasping)
Uh, not looking forward to being torn apart right now!
Anne: Marcy, any ideas?
Marcy: Three, two, one...
-(clucks)
(ants shrieking)
(roars)
(rumbling)
(all coughing)
Sprig: Huh, you know what? It actually smells kinda nice.
Marcy: (holding her nose) I mean, it will liquefy your lungs if you breathe too much of it, so...
Sprig: Well, time to go!
Marcy: Hey. Thanks for having my back.
Anne: Not that you needed it. You're right. You really have changed.
Hop Pop, Polly: Uh, you're on fire again.
Marcy: What?
(Everyone skids to a halt: Marcy's cape really is on fire again somehow.)
Marcy: Oh, come on! (Starts stomping on her cape) There wasn't even any fire this time!
(Everyone makes it out. Marcy grunts as she faceplants.)
Marcy: Mission success!
Sprig: Hey, uh, Marcy? Sorry for all the suspicion earlier. I was wrong about you. You're no backstabber.
Marcy: Hey, I'm just glad you're okay. It's obvious you mean a lot to Anne.
(Sprig smiles then cringes as he starts gurgling. He pukes up some of the Ant Queen's stomach acid, which lands on and dissolves Hop Pop's shirt instantly.)
Hop Pop: Nyeh! Dang it, Sprig!
(The kids laugh.)
Hop Pop: Oh, ha-ha.
(bell tolling)
(musical fanfare plays)
Marcy: Now, come on. Who's ready to go to Newtopia? And write up a detailed report!
Sprig, Polly: Yeah!
Sprig: Wait, what?
Polly: A report? Boo!
Anne: Wow. Marcy hasn't just changed, she's flourished. I've never seen her so happy.
Hop Pop: Always impressive what people are capable of, isn't it? (grunting) A little help, please?
(all) Whoa!
Anne: Whoa, look at this place!
Hop Pop: Mighty impressive.
Sprig: (gasps) I want to touch everything!
Anne: This is like a city, city.
-Huh?
-What's going on?
I didn't do it!
(clears throat)
Marcy: Well met, Lady Olivia.
Olivia: The king sends his greetings, Marcy. He trusts you have succeeded?
(Marcy imitates trumpet fanfare as she tosses a barbari-ant head forward.)
Olivia: Ah, still fresh, I see. Excellent work. As expected of the great Marcy Wu. (snaps fingers)
Guard: Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
Olivia: I see you have... company.
Marcy: Lady Olivia... (squeals) Meet Anne, one of the friends I was telling you about. Turns out she got transported to Frog Valley.
Olivia: Uh-huh.
Marcy: A little town called Wartwood.
Olivia: It's a pleasure to meet you, Anne.
Anne: You too, dude! Oh, uh, I mean... milady.
Marcy: Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Anne: Oh, oh... And these are the Plantars.
Hey there! 'Sup.
-Hello. We can bow too.
-Your Highness.
-(Polly and Sprig grunt)
-Oh!
(guard snickers)
Olivia: Yes, well, uh... Welcome to Newtopia, Plantars and Anne. This is an old city, but one rich in history and splendor. Please don't touch anything that looks important.
Sprig: Hey, look what I did! (grunts) I'm okay! Statue's broken.
Olivia: Do enjoy your stay.
Hop Pop: She seems friendly... ish.
Anne: So, are you like a big deal here or something?
Marcy: Let's just say I have a perfect record when it comes to missions.
Sprig: Okay. So, Marcy, I've got a couple of questions. How'd you get so smart? What's your cloak made out of? What's in this pouch? Where'd you get that wrist thing? (whispers) What was Anne like back home?
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Kids, will you help me get the fwagon unloaded? Let's give Anne and Marcy some space.
(groans) Fine. (groans) Buzzkill.
Marcy: So, you haven't found a way home either, huh?
Anne: Nerp. You know, it's funny. I've been hoping to find you for so long, but now that I actually found you, I have no idea what to do next.
Marcy: (chuckles) I know what you mean. First things first though. We have to find Sasha.
Anne: Oh! Actually, I did find Sasha. We, uh... we had a fight.
Marcy: No... Was it bad?
Anne: Er... There were maybe some swords, minor explosions. Anyways, I don't know where she is now. (sighs)
Marcy: Well, even if we find a way home, it's pointless without Sasha.
Anne: So, what now?
Marcy: I don't know. Back home, Sasha always decided the plan.
Anne: (chuckles) Yeah. Maybe it's time we started making our own decisions, huh?
Marcy: Yeah! I mean, it's worked out for us so far, right? Come on, stand up!
Anne: Uh... okay. Come on, Anne. Let me see that power pose!
Anne: (inhales) This good?
Marcy: Good enough! (clears throat) I'm Marcy Wu!
Anne: And, uh, I'm Anne Boonchuy!
Anne, Marcy: And together, we're gonna find Sasha and find a way home! (grunting, laughing)
Marcy: Oh, my gosh. Okay, so I wanna know everything that's happened to you since you got here. You got any photos?
Anne: Do I? Here's me and Domino 2. She tried to eat us. Here's me and Sprig by the lake. There was a snake that tried to eat us. Oh, oh! Here's us running from a giant centipede that...
Marcy: Let me guess. Tried to eat you?
Anne: (gasps) How did you know?
(bell tolling)
King Andrias: The pieces are starting to fall into place. It's time for the game to begin.
