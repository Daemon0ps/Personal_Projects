 In Hora Prandii Est Newtopia! 
Marcy: Enjoy, everyone! This place makes the best beetle burger in all of Newtopia!
Polly: (munching) What's that?
Marcy: Oh, just my journal. I like jottin' down theories and observations. You know, all about indigenous fauna, medicinal techniques, customs and nuances of Amphibious species-based caste systems... (Polly zones out as she speaks.) Sometimes I even do drawings.
Polly: (gasps) It looks just like me.
Hop Pop: Wow! Anne, have you been keeping a journal too?
Anne: (sticks two straws up her nose)Look, guys! I'm a straw-lrus! Like a walrus, but with straws!
Sprig: (laughs) What's a walrus?
Server: Now, who should I give the bill to? (glances at Anne) Probably not you.
Marcy: (after drawing the "straw-lrus" in her journal) Oh! I'll take it! It's, oh, let me guess... 28 coppers?
Server: Right you are.
(all oohing)
Hop Pop: Wow! Can you do math like that too, Anne?
Anne: (exhales) Uh, you mean like with numbers and stuff?
Polly: Can you imagine if Marcy got stuck with us instead of Anne? We'd be set for life!
Hop Pop: Hush, Polly. Think those thoughts, don't say them.
Oh, yeah? Well... (screams)
Look out! (all scream)
Someone's trying to kill us!
No, no. It's fine. It's just a message from the king. Oh, correction. It's a puzzle-gram from the king.
(all) What?
He's basically hidden clues around the city and when I collect them all, I get a message. Ah! It's so fun!
Okay, this first symbol is a tree, so we should head towards Coral Park. Now come on, team. It's puzzle time!
A puzzle tour of Newtopia? Count me in!
(all cheering)
Come on, Polly! This may be our most exciting adventure yet!
Hey, thanks for coming in. Would you like to join our customer loyalty program? You can get free gifts.
Gifts? Free?
Oh, no.
Wow! Whoa! Look at that!
Anne. You're not marveling. Is everything okay?
Well, I don't know. It's just... Marcy's always been the smart one in our group. I've always just felt kinda dumb around her.
What?
Shh! She'll hear you.
Sorry. Well, hey. Maybe if you can solve the king's puzzle gram before Marcy, it'll prove you're just as smart as she is.
Hmm. Well, I did get us out of that puzzle dungeon that one time.
Yeah, you did!
Mission "Prove I'm not a dumdum," engage!
(grunts)
Here it is, guys. Coral Park!
(both) Whoa.
(thinking) Okay, you can do this.
So, one eye open and one closed.
Hmm... Ooh!
What if we aren't supposed to look at the trees?
What if we're supposed to listen to them?
I love it!
Hmm, but I was also thinking,
this statue of Ezra Brackish is looking through a telescope.
He's got one eye open and one eye closed, right?
Gotcha!
"Bring."
So that's the first part of the message.
Brilliant! (gasps)
(chuckles) Okay.
So the next clue is...
Oh! I recognize this.
Come on, gang. Let's motor!
Maybe you'll have better luck on the next one?
Yeah, I can do this!
Let's go get that next clue!
Whoop! Whoop!
(both) Whoo-hoo!
Goblin! Come on, girl!
Goblin, get down from there!
Don't worry. I got you.
(grunting)
(meows)
Thanks, lady. No worries.
I actually have one just like that back home. But with less legs.
(Sprig) Anne, come on! Whoop, gotta go!
Don't let that thing grow up.
Catch you later! (meows)
(all) Hmm.
Why the "W"? I mean, what's that supposed to mean?
Let me take this one, Mar-Mar. Okay.
Hmm.
(straining)
You'll never solve me!
Ah! I mean, oh... I see.
Hey, I gotta go to the bathroom! BRB!
Hey, can I see your crossbow arm? I don't see why not?
(panting) Okay...
Gotta find help. Um...
Aha!
An old person! Old people love puzzles.
Psst, hey. Wanna solve a puzzle?
Ooh! Looks like a juicy one.
Pull up some bench, dear.
The name's Doris. Anne.
Okay, any idea what this symbol has to do with the museum?
Oh! My son Harris used to work at the museum.
Oh, wait, no. Harris worked at the library.
Dusty worked at the museum. Or was it Dave?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. How many sons do you have?
Whoa.
Hmm.
I wonder if...
(screeches) (thuds)
(gasps) I knew this looked familiar!
The lines between the bricks of this west side wall of the museum
match up perfectly with the street grid of Newtopia.
Which puts us right about...
here!
"Me."
"Bring... me..."
(gasps) Only one clue left to go!
Well, if Dusty is upset about what Buster said, he should just tell him so.
Mmm-hmm. Hey, Anne.
So... Marcy figured out the second puzzle.
The puzzle! Sorry, Doris. Gotta run.
-It was nice talking to you. -You too, Anne.
Don't forget my offer to set you up with one of my sons.
Doris, stop it! (laughs)
Hey, Anne. Glad you could catch up.
Take a look at the final clue.
It's referring to the big bridge downtown. Come on!
Hop Pop, Polly! We're goin' to the bridge!
Take me with you!
Polly, look!
Just 987 more lunches, and we get a free suit of armor!
(groans)
Okay, Anne. One clue left.
Yeah, and Marcy'll probably solve it before we get there.
Oh, come on. So she's good at puzzles.
That doesn't mean she's smart and you're dumb.
Thanks, dude. Huh?
(gasps) Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know.
I made a few suggestions on how to increase the weight limit,
and they kinda, like, named it after me.
Now, come on! Let's see where this triangle fits in.
Okay, so she designed a bridge. That doesn't mean...
Please stop. Yeah, okay.
Why don't you go ahead? I think I need a moment alone.
Uh, okay.
Just holler if you need something.
(groans)
What? My trays! I got 'em!
(strains, grunts)
Thank you, sweetie!
Here, have some gnatchos on the house.
Thanks! My name's Anne, by the way.
I'm Gertie. Nice to meet ya.
(sighs)
Something got you down, Anne?
Have you ever had a friend who's so smart, they make you feel dumb?
Honey, this is Newtopia. Everyone here's a genius.
And then there's me, with my dumb old gnatcho cart.
What? Gertie, don't say that.
You're an independent businesswoman. You've got it goin' on!
(chuckles) Oh, aren't you a sweet one!
You wanna know my trick? Fake it till you make it.
If you act like you're smart, everyone assumes you are.
Really? That works?
Mm-hmm. I don't know the first thing about cooking, and look at me.
I'm a famous chef!
Well, I'm a chef.
Well, I'm in the food business.
(Sprig) Hey, Anne! Marcy and I are stumped. Get over here!
(Anne) All right. What do we got here?
Hmm. Okay.
Easy.
(thinking) Come on, Anne... fake it.
So, a triangle has three sides, right?
Three rhymes with, er... "tea."
You brew tea with water,
and there's water in, uh...
The sewer! Let's go down there.
Whoa! This sewer's shockingly clean.
There's actually a reason for that. I...
(both) Rehauled the sewer system?
How'd you know that?
Hey! Check that out.
That looks just like the circle in the clue.
Kinda. We obviously have to turn it.
(clanking)
(Marcy) Speak of the devil!
Here comes one of my improvements!
(alligator) Whoo-hoo. Ooh!
Would you guys believe that in addition to eating live meat...
Ooh!
...these babies love eating trash?
Go, go, go! Let's move!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo!
(panting)
(straining) Holy crud, that's heavy!
(Gertie) Gnatchos! Get your gnatchos!
Gertie? Is that you?
It's me, Anne. I need help!
Anne?
Don't worry, kiddo. I got ya!
(As Anne and Gertie struggle to open the sewer drain, with Sprig and Marcy waiting, the gator leaps up and tries to grab Marcy, but she dodges it as she yelps. Then, Gertie finally gets the drain open.)
Gertie: Got it! Here, grab my arm!
Anne: Come on, Mar Mar.
(Marcy grabs Anne's hand, but suddenly, she lowers down a bit.)
Marcy: Hey!
(The gator is shown to have grabbed Marcy's cape with his teeth. Then, Marcy quickly removes her cape, causing the gator to splash back down.)
Anne, you hang in there, you hear? Anne!
Did you say "Anne"? The tall, gangly creature?
-She saved my Goblin. We gotta help her! -(clanking)
Okay, they said they'd be at the bridge. Do you see 'em?
(Gertie) Hang in there, Anne!
-We'll save you, Anne! -(alligator roars)
Typical.
Ooh, looks like this is it!
Grab on! Hop Pop, now!
(roars)
Anne, what happened? Are you okay?
Can't you go ten minutes on your own
without getting into some kind of crazy danger?
Aw, give her a break, Hop Pop.
Anne's already sad because Marcy's so smart she makes her feel dumb.
Sprig! What?
Anne, is that true?
I don't know. Maybe?
I guess I get a little jealous of you sometimes.
I mean, you're so smart, and I'm... not.
Anne, that's insane.
Besides, I'm jealous of you.
Huh? What for?
Yeah, what for?
You get along with people so well.
Three people you met today
just risked their lives to save you.
(meows)
Heck, the Plantars here adopted you and would do anything for you.
Yeah, sure, I'm good at solving puzzles and calculating the check, but you're amazing at making connections. (looks away blushing shyly) Me, I have trouble looking people in the eye sometimes.
Thanks, Marcy. Maybe that's why we make such a good team. Come here, you.
Aw!
Hey, anyone else want a snack?
That nice lady gave me some gnatchos.
Whoa! Wait a sec, it's... Look!
The symbol... it's a gnatcho!
Sprig, empty that tray!
(all gasp)
(Marcy) That means the message is...
"Bring me the Plantars."
Oh, guys, we've been summoned!
And you solved the puzzle gram, Anne!
Self-esteem boost and an audience with the ruler of this world? Win-win, baby!
(all cheering)
So... you guys wanna feed gnatchos to that alligator?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
(munches) Ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Just look how happy it makes him.
