Polly: (chewing)
Anne: Yo guys! Check it out! I got a Mail-Fly message! Look how cute he is.
Mail-Fly: (buzzes)
Polly: (blows a raspberry) Jealous, I never get mail.
Sprig: Open it, open it!
Anne: It's from Marcy! She says we're ready to travel to the first temple.
Sprig: Alright!
Polly: Woo!
Anne: Ooh. She even included a checklist of things to bring. Let's see here. "Food. Weapons."
Sprig: Check!
Polly: Double check!
Sprig: Aah!
Polly: Jumpy little fella.
Anne: Cool, what else? "Armor." Armor?
Hop Pop: Got it covered! Believe it or not, I made each of you your very own suit of armor.
Sprig: Whoa!
Polly: Cool!
Anne: Seriously?
(The "suits" are actually massively inflated, limiting everybody's movements. Anne fall back onto the couch, unable to get back up.)
Anne: (grunts) I'm down! Anne's down!
Polly: Hop Pop! (groaning) This is the opposite of a suit of armor.
Hop Pop: Exactly. Less mobility means less trouble.
Polly: Yeah, yeah. Hey Anne, anything else on that list?
Anne: Oh yeah, just one more thing. "The Music Box!"
(Hop Pop then gets shocked for a second realizing about the music box)
Hop Pop: Uh, right, the music box. No problem. My contacts will have it ready by tomorrow.
Anne: Great! You're the best.
Hop Pop: (light chuckle)
Anne: All packed and ready to go. Ah! Too excited to sleep!
(footsteps)
Anne: Sounds like someone else can't sleep either.
Hop Pop: (grunting)
Anne: (giggles) Classic old Hop Pop bein' a freak. I'm gonna give that nerd a little scare.
Hop Pop: (gasps) I-it can't be. The music box. It's gone!
Anne: What?
(Hop Pop then sees Anne who was behind him and screams)
Hop Pop: Anne, what are you doin' here?
Anne: Did you just say...the music box is gone?
Hop Pop: I can't lie anymore! I buried the box here. And now it's missing!
Anne: Wait, what!? But you said your contacts were gonna--
Hop Pop: There were no contacts! I read the box was dangerous. I didn't know what to do! I panicked! You gotta understand. I was just trying to protect Sprig and Polly!
Anne: So you've been lying to me? This whole time?
Hop Pop: No! Well, yes, but... it's complicated!
Anne: No, it isn't! I need the music box to get home, and you buried it under a tree! What're you trying to do, keep me here forever? (gasps) That's it, isn't it? You sicko.
Hop Pop: No, no! I-it's not like that. I-it's just...I've lost so much already and--
Anne: Stop. (sighs, sniffs) Look, I can't be here right now.
Hop Pop: Anne!
Anne: Don't follow me. Don't! I see you!
Hop Pop: (sighs)
(the next day...)
Sprig & Polly: Quest, quest, quest! Quest, quest, quest!
Sprig: Hold up.
(Hop Pop looks overslept and miserable with a coffee mug in his right hand, looking at the window)
Sprig: Uh, Hop Pop, are you okay?
Hop Pop: (turns around) I really mucked it up this time, kids. (deep breath) I lied to Anne about the music box and I buried it under the tree out front.
Sprig & Polly: What!?
Hop Pop: (chuckle) Oh, it gets worse. When I went to dig it up last night, it was gone! Anne saw the whole thing and ran off. I've been waiting all night for her to come back.
Sprig: Look, Hop Pop, I don't know why you did what you did, but you gotta fix it.
Polly: Yeah! You gotta get out there and bring Anne back!
Hop Pop: You're right. I caused this mess, so dang it, I'm gonna clean it up! (slurps the cup and breaks it) And then I'm gonna clean that up.
Sprig & Polly: (sigh)
Polly: Well, this is a bummer.
Sprig: We gotta find that music box or Anne'll never forgive him.
Polly: Right on! Let's motor, bro-bro!
(whirring)
(cawing)
Hop Pop: Hmm. If there was only some clue as to which way she went--
(clink)
Hop Pop: A bobby pin? And hairbrush, mascara, sunglasses, teen magazine. I think I'm on the right track.
Anne: (yawn) Never thought I'd be sleepin' in this cave again. Not since the Plantars took me in. Well, at least I'll always have you, Rocky. Sweet, sweet dependable Rocky. Yeah, I just can't take you seriously with that hair.
Sprig: All right, maybe someone in town has seen the music box.
Sprig & Polly: Whoa.
Townsperson: My veggies!
Mayor Toadstool: Well, there goes the school money, Toadie.
Mrs. Croaker: Archie?
Sprig: Hey Maddie, what's going on?
Maddie: Someone dug a bunch of holes and stole stuff from everyone in town. I even lost a talisman that, if it fell into the wrong hands, would bring an end to all...living--I've said too much.
Polly: Who would dig a bunch of holes in the ground?
Soggy Joe: Holes in the ground, eh? And missing valuables too? Sounds like the work of the Magpie beetle.
Sprig: Never heard of it.
Polly: You gotta stop popping out of bushes, Soggy Joe.
Soggy Joe: The Magpie beetle is a rare breed of insect that lives underground. Every 20 years it burrows to the surface and steals junk to make its shell. It presents that shell to prospective mates in a ritual called the "love-nado dance."
Polly: Ew.
Soggy Joe: A spectacle much too dangerous to observe--You really should hear the rest of this!
Polly: On a mission!
Sprig: Thanks, Joe!
(squeaking)
Sprig: (panting)
Polly: Sprig, look! Soggy Joe was right. There's a burrow off to the side. Come on!
Sprig: Think this'll lead us to the box?
Polly: There's only one way to find out. (groans)
Sprig & Polly: (shouting)
Sprig: Where are we?
Polly: Oh no, Sprig! We're right smack dab in the middle of the love-nado! Maybe we should've listened to the end of Soggy Joe's thing.
Sprig: Okay, the music box has to be here somewhere. Whoa! We have to find it!
Sprig & Polly: Whoa!
Polly: (screams)
Sprig: (gasp) There it is!
(clinks)
Sprig: Alright, I'm goin' for it!
Polly: Wait! Sprig, no!
Sprig: Aah! (screams)
Polly: Sprig! Wait! No!
Anne: I thought I knew him, you know? But he was lying to me the whole time. Wish I had my bobby pins. (shouts) Oh. (scoffs) It's you. Go away.
Hop Pop: Please, Anne. Just let me explain.
Anne: I am not talking to you right now, Hop Pop. If that's even your real name. Oh, wait. Hop Pop's a nickname.
Hop Pop: I need you to know why I hid the music box. It's dangerous. I was just trying to protect the family.
Anne: Then why did you lie?
Hop Pop: Well, because...there's something I've never told you. Something hard to talk about. (sighs) The truth is...
(the moment stops as Anne and Hop Pop heard Polly and Sprig screaming)
Anne: That sounds like-
Hop Pop: Sprig! Polly!
(Anne and Hop Pop ran to see what's going on)
Anne: What the heck is this?!
Hop Pop: It's some kind of love monsoon.
Sprig & Polly: Help! Help!
Hop Pop: Anne, we have to work together.
Anne: Work with you? Not gonna happen. I'll save them myself! Whoa. Whoa!
(Anne tries to save them, jumping through Magpie beetles before slipping to a sad frog clown picture and hanging on to the top of Loggle's sculpture)
Hop Pop: (OS) Please, Anne. (onscreen) I know I lied to you, but trust me. At least long enough to save the kids.
Sprig & Polly: (screaming)
(Anne agrees as Hop Pop and Anne jumped through the beetles, Hop Pop releasing the tongue to stick on Anne's right arm and grabs on to it.)
Anne: (grunting) Sprig! Grab on!
(Sprig grabs Anne's hand while Polly grabs Sprig's hand)
Polly: (grabs the music box) Yoink. (screams)
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Hang on!
(Hop Pop starts to spin them around and like a grappling hook, they fly off back to the grass)
Anne: (panting)
(Anne grabs the music box and hugs it)
Sprig & Polly: Woo-hoo!
Polly: That was amazing!
Sprig: I can't believe we did it!
Anne: Yeah, we did. And now... (puts the music box in her backpack) we're through here.
(Anne starts to leave)
Sprig: Anne, no!
Polly: Where will you go?
Anne: I'll go stay with someone who isn't a liar. I don't know, maybe Loggle? He seems like a straight shooter.
Hop Pop: Anne, wait. Let me at least explain. What I did wasn't right. But I didn't do it to trick ya.
(Anne continues walking until...)
Hop Pop: (sigh) Sprig and Polly's parents.
(Anne stops walking as Polly and Sprig are shocked)
Polly: Hop Pop.
Sprig: That wasn't your fault.
Hop Pop: It was a few years ago. I was on a journey when the herons attacked Wartwood. Sprig and Polly survived. But their parents... weren't so lucky.
(a heron screeches)
(transition to the present)
Hop Pop: If I just had been there... I know things would've been different! Ever since then, I swore I'd never let my family down again. That I'd do anything to protect them. So when I found out the box was dangerous, I lied to you and hid it away. I thought I was protecting my family. But now I realize how foolish it was. You're my family too. And I've let you down. I let us all down. (starts breaking down in tears) I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm just so sorry!
(Anne, moved by this, walks to Hop Pop, and hugs him)
Hop Pop: Huh?
Anne: Hop Pop, I forgive you.
(they embraced)
Sprig: Reconciliation!
Polly: Frog pile!
All: (laughing)
Anne: Can we get out of this rain?
(the next day, it's sunny out after the rain)
Hop Pop: This book has been in our family for as long as I can remember. And look.
Sprig: Whoa.
Polly: Cool.
Anne: "Calamity Box"? Eesh. That does sound bad.
Hop Pop: Yeah. Not exactly comforting.
Sprig: I guess all we can do now is wait for Marcy.
Anne: Yeah. Guys, I hate to say it, but this temple quest may be more dangerous than we thought.
Hop Pop: Well, Anne, think this gang can handle it?
Anne: After today, I'm pretty sure this gang can handle anything.
(Anne and the Plantars embrace)
Polly: Awww.
(cut to the Plantar Farm)
Hop Pop (OS): You kids sure you don't wanna wear the puffy suits?
Sprig, Anne, & Polly (OS): Hop Pop.
Hop Pop (OS): Okay, okay, just had to ask.
