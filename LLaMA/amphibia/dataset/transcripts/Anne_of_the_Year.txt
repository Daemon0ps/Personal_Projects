Anne: Man, what is with this crowd? Are fruit flies on sale or something?
Hop Pop: (laughs) No. Today's the day they announce the Frog of the Year award.
Anne: Frog of the what?
Sprig: Frog of the hoppin' Year, Anne. Every year, the town gets together and votes on the frog they think best embodies the values of Wartwood.
Polly: We all voted last week. Don't you remember?
Anne: Huh. Not at all. Wonder why.
(Cut to a flashback of Anne sitting on the couch wearing earphones and listening to rock music. Hop Pop, Sprig, and Polly approach Anne from behind as music plays.)
Hop Pop: Anne, we're gonna go vote for Frog of the Year now. Wanna come?
(music playing)
Anne:  No, you'll never make me go! 
Hop Pop: Okay, then. (The Plantars leave.)
Anne: Break it down!
(Cut back to the present where Anne is thinking before she notices Mayor Toadstool walking up to a stage.)
Mayor Toadstool: All right, folks. It's time! (chuckles) As you all know, the Frog of the Year goes to the most selfless, noble, blah, blah, blah... Let's get on with it.
(He opens an envelope.)
Mayor Toadstool: And this year's Frog of the Year award goes to... Well, this can't be right. Anne Boonchuy?!
(Everyone in the audience gasps, but they burst into cheers, except for Anne who is surprised at this.)
Hop Pop: (pushing Anne to the stage) Go on, Anne. Get up there! A Plantar, Frog of the Year. I'm so proud.
(Hop Pop wipes a tear and it gets stuck to his finger.)
(Anne gets up to the stage and sees everyone giving her a big encore, making her feel extremely touched.)
Anne: Wow! Thanks, everyone. I don't know what to say.
Mayor Toadstool: I do. Are you people out of your frog-dang minds?! She don't deserve to host a party!
Anne: Party? What party?
Toadie: Oh, it's one of our oldest traditions. The Frog of the Year has to put on an incredible party for the whole town.
Mayor Toadstool: Yeah. And that party is supposed to demonstrate the Frog of the Year's selflessness. Anne isn't selfless. Far from it.
Anne: (stammers) You don't know me. I'll prove I deserve this by putting on a party so big, it'll blow all your minds! (echoes)
(all murmuring)
Frog: I don't want my mind blown.
Anne: That's... a good thing!
Frog: Oh, okay.
(crowd cheers)
Mayor Toadstool: I'm looking forward to seeing this thing go down in flames.
Anne: (grumbles)
(Cut to the Plantar farm, where Anne slams her plans for the party onto the table.)
Anne: Boom! Here are my plans for throwing the best party ever and proving that mayor wrong. Stupid mayor with his stupid dumb face.
Anne, don't worry about what the mayor said.
Just have fun planning your party.
You're Frog of the Year.
Anne: Right, right, right, right. Okay, guys, listen up. A great party has three ingredients: entertainment, exclusivity, and spectacle. Hop Pop, you're in charge of entertainment. I dub thee Master of Ceremonies.
Hop Pop: (gasps) I've been waiting for this day my whole life.
Anne: Polly, exclusivity. It's your job to decide who gets into the party and who doesn't.
Polly: (gasps) I can't wait to abuse this power!
Sprig: (singsong) And what about me?
Anne: Sprig, you have the most important job of all: the spectacle.
Sprig: Oh, my frog, oh, my frog, oh, my frog!
Anne: At the party...
Sprig: (squeal)
Anne: ...you're gonna tell Ivy how you feel about her!
Sprig: Wha-- Huh?
Anne: Yup. A legendary party needs a legendary spectacle. Can you imagine how excited party-goers will be to see true love blossom before their eyes?
Sprig: I'm not really sure I'm ready for this.
Anne: Sprig, please! I need your help to make this party amazing.
Sprig: (groans) Okay.
Anne: Whoo-hoo! Come on, everyone. Let's bring the thunder.
(all cheer)
(jackhammering)
All right, let's see how things are going.
Stumpy, stew's lookin' good. Decorations are up, glassware's looking polished.
Loggle, love that statue. Hey!
All right, Mr. Emcee, let's hear some jokes.
Okay. Have you heard about the snail who went on a diet?
He's a shell of his former self!
(drumroll)
Hmm. Okay, okay. A little soft, but keep working on it.
Sprig, my man. Let's see how that romantic proposal is going.
(clears throat) So it's gonna go a little something like this, okay?
Uh, Ivy, I got, uh, s-something to tell you, uh-- Oop!
(groans)
(yells)
Anne: No, no! This needs work too. (gasps) Polly? That's not what those are for.
Polly: (chuckles) Says you.
(grunts)
Mayor Toadstool: What'd I tell you, Toadie? She's gonna be the worst Frog of the Year ever. (Ever echoes)
Anne: (groans) No, no, no, no! I told you guys. This party has to be lit. At this rate, it's gonna be lame. Hop Pop, lemme see those jokes. (Hop Pop hands her the jokes) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know what? Written jokes are passe. Why don't you get up there and do some improv?
Hop Pop: Improv? I've never done that before.
Anne: Sprig, work on that proposal. Get some confidence. Come on. (to Loggle) Loggle! I'm gonna need you to re-do that statue. Make it cooler.
Loggle: You serious?!
Anne: Stumpy, you gotta throw that slop out and replace it with somethin' fancier. Like, I don't know. Sashimi.
Stumpy: What's a sashimi?
Anne: It's fresh fish, okay? Get it. Burn these decorations and get new ones. Replace that jug band with a deejay. And where the heck is that chocolate fountain?!
(groaning)
Sprig: Uh, Anne, do you think maybe you're taking this a little too seriously?
Anne: NO! Now, hop to it, everyone. We've only got 12 hours left. Hop! Hop!
(music playing)
(female) Oh, I'm so excited. (male) You said it.
Polly: You. You. Uh-uh! Not you.
Wally: Aw!
Polly: I'm just kidding, Wally. Get in there.
Wally: Validation! (cackles)
(all gasping)
Anne: Welcome, my friends, to the best Frog of the Year party ever!
(party music playing)
(all gasp)
Yo, I'm a frog deejay.
(male) Is that a chocolate fountain?
Mayor Toadstool: All right, Stumpy, what do we got here?
Stumpy: This is Sashimi. He's a mudskipper.
Mayor Toadstool: Ooh. And is it, uh, fresh?
Stumpy: Well, ya can't get fresher.
(gasps)
(screams)
(grunting)
(exclaims)
(nervous chuckles) All right, folks. It's time for some improv.
You, sir, where are you from?
I'm from the same town as you, buddy.
Oh!
Great.
(feedback screeching) (crowd murmurs)
-Whoa. -(gulps)
(sighs) I can do this, I can do this, I can do this.
(grunts) For Anne!
-(yells) -Oh, hey, Sprig.
(whimpers)
-(yells) -(techno music playing)
I don't know how to dance to this.
What?
Anne: Like this, you guys! Like this!
Hop Pop: Have someone else do your comedy, Anne! I can't go back out there!
Anne: Hop Pop!
(crowd screaming)
This thing's gonna kill us.
I know. It's loaded with mercury.
Anne: (sighs) This party stinks. Some selfless Frog of the Year I turned out to be.
(villager screams)
(all gasp)
(screaming)
(screams)
Loggle: At least the party's "lit" now, Anne.
(all screaming)
Anne: I'm fixing this right now.
(panting)
(shouts)
-Come here, you. -(neighing)
I knew it. Didn't I say it'd be a disaster? Ooh!
Mayor Toadstool, I need your help to save the town.
Me? Work with you? Ha!
(grunts) Okay, well, just this once.
Great. I'll steer, you grab.
Don't tell me what to do.
Upsy-daisy! I got ya.
Vote for me.
(all screaming)
We've gotta put this fire out. You ever use a chocolate fountain before?
What, are you kidding me?
(Anne) Now!
Let 'er rip. (grunts)
(laughs) Whoo! We did it.
Yeah. We did.
You were right about me, Mayor. I am selfish.
I got so obsessed with proving I deserve this, I ruined everything.
I'm no Frog of the Year. Why did anyone even vote for me?
Anne, we didn't vote for you because you're flawless. (chuckles) Far from it.
We voted for you because of how far you've come.
You've grown so much in your time here,
and this town just wouldn't be the same without you.
-(crowd cheering) -Hear, hear.
That's why I voted for her.
Mayor Toadstool: Gosh dang it, I tried to fight it, but I have to say, even I'm a little impressed with how you just saved the town from a raging inferno. Here. This belongs to you.
Anne: Thanks, Mayor.
Mayor Toadstool: Yeah, yeah. Don't mention it. Now come on, everyone. Let's try to salvage this party, shall we?
(all cheer)
(folk music)
Stumpy: All right. (guffaws) Who's a good little mudskipper?
Anne: Sorry I tried to rush you into confessing your love to Ivy. You do that when you're good and ready.
Sprig: Thanks, Anne. When the moment strikes, I'll know it.
Ivy: Hey, Sprig. There's something I've, uh, been meaning... to ask you. I, uh... Do you, um... (clears throat) Do you think you'd wanna go out with me sometime?
Sprig: (gasps)
Anne: (squeals)
Ivy: (Blushes in embarrassment) Never mind. I'm stupid. This is stupid. This is stupid.
Sprig: Ivy, wait! I'd love to. Mlep! Wanna dance?
Ivy: Heck yeah!
(both giggling)
Anne: (laughs)
Toadie: Ahem! Miss Frog of the Year? There's someone waiting at the bridge for you. They say they're a friend.
Anne: ...A friend?
(Anne goes out to the bridge. Aboard it is a hooded Sasha, now clad in toad armor; she takes off her hood in surprise...)
Sasha: Anne?!
Anne: Sasha?!
(screams)
(both laughing)
Anne: Oh, my gosh! I can't believe that it's you!
(both laughing)
Anne: Oh, my gosh. You're here too? I wasn't sure. I woke up all alone and... (gasps) Is Marcy with you? Where have you been? I've missed you so much!
Sasha: (giggles) I'll fill you in later. For now, I'm just glad I found you. We came as soon as we heard.
(Pause.)
Anne: (confused) "We"?
Sasha: Yup. Just me and some friends of mine.
(bug buzzing)
(crunching)
Captain Grime: Nice to finally meet you, Anne Boonchuy.
