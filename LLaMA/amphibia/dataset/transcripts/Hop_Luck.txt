(The frog being carried by a dragonfly soars through the sky.)
Frog: Aah! Help! Somebody help me!
(Anne shows Sprig and Polly a video on her phone.)
Anne: And this bad boy is my kitty Domino.
(Domino meows.)
Anne: You guys would like her. She's got fire. Sprig: Ooh!
Polly: Aw, she's so tiny! I feel huge!
Sprig: Hmm. I will... (pulls out a hammer) set her free!
(Anne reclaims her phone.)
Anne: Please stop doing that.
(sizzling)
Anne: (sniffs) Ugh! What is that? Did something crawl under the house and die?
Sprig: (sniffing) Worse, Anne. Much worse. Hop Pop is cooking!
Sprig: Brace yourself.
Anne: Brace myself for what?
Sprig: Aah! (screaming)
(humming) Hop Pop: Mmm! (slurping)
Sprig: What's the plan this year, Hop Pop? Poison the competition? Ooh!
Hop Pop: The plan is to win.
Anne: Win?
Hop Pop: The annual village potluck. Every year we frogs gather for a great contest. The family who brings the best-tasting dish is showered with love and copper coins. The family with the worst-tasting dish spends the night in... (thunderclap)
Hop Pop: the shame cage!
Anne: Brutal.
Sprig: And guess which family ends up there every year.
(all three sigh)
Anne: If you think I'm gonna let my favorite froggy family end up in a cage, you've got another thing coming. I know I'm not technically a Plantar, but maybe I can help.
All: Mmm!
Sprig: Anne, we'd sure appreciate it.
Anne: So, what you making over there, Hop Pop? Sock gumbo?
Hop Pop: No, silly. It's a traditional recipe from my family's cookbook. We been using this baby since I was a pollywog.
Anne: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think I found your problem, guys.
(all gasp)
Anne: Old things are dumb!
(gulps)
Polly: Oh, that makes sense.
Sprig: It's all so clear now.
Hop Pop: But we Plantars have always cooked these recipes. What would my great-gam-gam say?
Anne: She'd say "Move on."
Hop Pop: (sighs) She was a fierce woman.
Anne: Look, if we're gonna win this thing, we need something new, something revolutionary, something no one in the swamp has ever seen before. Something like...
Sprig: (gasps)
Anne: pizza!
Sprig: Whoa.
Polly: I don't know what it is, but I love it.
Anne: Pizza is the ultimate dish. You haven't lived until you've shared one with your friends at the mall.
Hop Pop: Now, now, hold on. Before we get carried away, what about this tried-and-true recipe? Swamp mold pot pie!
Sprig/Polly: Pizza! Pizza!
Hop Pop: Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Sprig: We'll win for sure with this, Hop Pop.
Anne: Now all we gotta do is-- (clears throat) All we gotta do is get four ingredients-- dough, cheese, basil, and tomatoes. Are you guys ready to make our pizza dreams a pizza reality?
Sprig/Polly: Pizza dreams! Sprig: Oh! Oh! Maybe we should put pineapple on it. Seems like a natural fit. (groans as Anne pins him to the wall)
Anne: (whispers) Don't you dare talk about pineapple on my pizza. Ever. Okay. Let's go get those ingredients. Pizza dreams!
Sprig: (weakly) Pizza dreams.
Polly: (shakes Sprig) Pizza dreams!
(Flies buzz around a roll of flour as Mr. Flour, the baker, stomps on it before throwing it into his oven.)
Mr. Flour: If you want the dough, the boy has to marry my daughter.
(Reveals Maddie Flour with a voodoo doll of Sprig as ominous music is heard.)
Maddie: Hiiiii, Spriiiiiiig...
Mr. Flour: Ain't she adorable?
Anne: Done.
Hop Pop: You know, if we used a traditional recipe, we wouldn't have to sell Sprig.
Anne: No! That old book is old. Sprig's eternal happiness is a small price to pay for pizza.
Polly: Agreed.
Sprig: Aw, it's not so bad. Maybe we'll learn to love each other. Aah!
Maddie: I've seen your death in my mind.
Sprig: I was kinda hoping it'd be a surprise. (chuckles)
Maddie: (whispers) It will be.
(sinister chuckle, slowed down)
Anne: Congratulations on your new son. Now cough up the dough.
Mr. Flour: Yay!
Anne: Pleasure doing business with ya.
Sprig: Well, looks like we gotta go. (chuckles) See ya.
Polly: I wanna be the maid of honor!
Maddie: See you soon, hubby...
(flies clucking like chickens)
(all screaming)
(roaring)
Mrs. Croaker: Thanks again for helping me out! I know Brutus can be a handful.
(bellowing)
Sprig: What are we here for again?
Anne: Cheese!
Polly: (laughing)
Hop Pop: You know, there's a recipe in here that doesn't need cheese.
Anne: No old recipes! Huh? (panting) (gasps) Hey, Brutus! Over here! !Toro! !Toro!
(roaring)
Anne: (laughs) Oh, come on!
Sprig: Blah!
Anne: (grunts, sighs)
Anne/Sprig: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Brutus roars.)
Mrs. Croaker: Here you go, deary. A hunk of cheese made fresh from the milk of those ca--
Anne: Please don't tell me where it comes from.
Anne: Hey, careful with that basil, dude. We had to fight off like ten giant aphids to get it.
Sprig: Who knew ultimate flavor could be so painful?
Hop Pop: Almost lost my behind to those things.
Sprig: This is the price of progress, Hop Pop.
Anne: Exactly. And we've only got one ingredient left. Tomatoes. According to this, they should be up ahead.
Hop Pop: Still can't believe I traded my favorite dentures for that map.
Sprig: You know, I've never actually tasted a tomato. No one in town really sells them.
Hop Pop: There's a reason for that. They're in the "dangerous vegetables" section. It suggests we go for prunes instead. Can't go wrong with prunes!
Anne: Whoa-whoa. "Dangerous vegetables"? Come on!
(roaring)
Polly: Ho...
Sprig: ly...
Anne: ...tomato.
(roars)
Hop Pop: You know, this baby's got some great substitutes, all of which are delightfully harmless.
Sprig: Couldn't hurt to hear a few options.
Anne: Hold on! Guys, the shame cage isn't just in the town square. It's up here. You're not gonna change the world without taking a few risks. We need to be bold, groundbreaking, brave!
Hop Pop: Anne, there's a big difference between courage and stupidity! (screaming)
(roaring)
All: Hop Pop! (yell)
(Anne panting)
(all yelling)
Sprig: My fiancee was right! (all grunting)
Hop Pop: Holy smokes! Acid!
Anne: Well, at least the ingredients are safe. No!
(echoing)
Anne: The ingredients! Everything we've worked for!
Sprig: At least it'll be a quick, painless death.
Polly: Why would this be painless?
Sprig: Just let me have this lie!
Anne: (sighs) My revolutionary ideas were supposed to save you guys, not get you killed. I shouldn't have so stubborn. I just really wanted to share a pizza with you guys.
Hop Pop: Ah, I didn't care about that pizza stuff anyway. But you were really trying to help this family out, and that's worth something in my book.
Anne: Your book? That's it. Is there anything in the old ways that could help us right now?
Hop Pop: Well, I don't know. Nothing especially useful. Just that the throat of this giant tomato plant is absolutely delicious eaten raw.
(loud burp)
(gurgling)
(chomping)
(all yelling)
(all roaring)
(loud groaning)
Polly: (spits) Know your place, plant!
(bell tolling)
Anne: There isn't much time. Let's go home and make one of your old recipes, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Yup. But maybe we can spruce it up with something a little dangerous.
Frog: Yup. Still up here. Still need help.
Frog #1: Put it right over here.
Frog #2: Just a little touch of goodness.
Frog #3 A few more bug legs should do it.
Frog #4 Is that fly gonna say up there?
Anne/Hop Pop: Perfect.
(fanfare)
Mayor Toadstool: All right! Let the annual potluck begin! Let's get to tastin' those dishes. Mmm! That is "scrumptious." Oh! Ooh! What have we here? (chomping) Oh, that is delicious! Yeah! Excellent effort! And last, but not least-- (sighs) the Plantars. What filth have you cooked up this ti-- Hmm? Tomato? That's awfully dangerous. (chuckles) Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!
(drumroll)
Mayor Toadstool: Why, I do declare! This is the best dish the Plantar family has ever brought to a potluck!
Hop Pop: What?
(all gasping)
Sprig: What? Did we do it? Did we actually win?
Mayor Toadstool: Win? No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, it's better than usual, but it's still terrible. Last place, as usual.
(sad "wah-wah" theme plays)
Mayor Toadstool: You folks should know the way to the shame cage by now. Hurry along. All right, boys, light it up.
(all sigh)
Sprig: Cheer up, guys. Sure we came in last. Again. But thanks to Anne's new ideas and Hop Pop's old ones, we've done the best we've ever done.
Hop Pop: You know, he's right.
Polly: Yeah!
Anne: We did, didn't we? Uh, this is weird, but... any chance I could squeeze in there?
Hop Pop: How 'bout it, Carl?
Carl: The more the merrier.
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Hear that?
Sprig: Get in here, you crazy kid.
Anne: Whoo-hoo!
Carl: (grunting)
Anne: Well, if we can't share a pizza, at least we can share this. And you know, honestly, this isn't so bad... Hey, what the heck? What was that?
Sprig: Ooh, I forgot to mention the shame nuggets. (crowd jeering)
Frogs: You people should be ashamed!
Mr. Flour: Hey! That's my son-in-law!
Sprig: Hi.
Polly: Is that the best you got?
Hop Pop: (sighs) Tradition is such a beautiful-- Son of a slug!
