Hop Pop: Hmm.
Sprig: I beat you once, I can do it again. I'll prove my way is right.
Hop Pop: We'll see.
Sprig: (grunts)
Polly: Let the final challenge begin!
(both screaming)
Hop Pop: The girls told me everything, Sprig.
Sprig: What? (yells)
Hop Pop: You're destroying the farm. Don't you see? Even if you win, you lose.
Sprig: (grunts)
Hop Pop: Ow.
Sprig: So I'm just supposed to go back to the way things were? You never listened to us.
Hop Pop: And I was wrong. I know now that you can't work together unless everyone has a say. Jeremy taught me that.
(both grunt)
Sprig: You... You mean it? I have to admit, most of my ideas were pretty terrible. I think we even caused permanent damage to the ecosystem.
Hop Pop: Yeah, but some of your ideas could work. We'll never know unless we try. I promise from now on to actually read your suggestions.
(all gasp)
Sprig: Promise?
Hop Pop: Promise.
(exhales)
Polly: And the winner is Hop Pop!
(sighs)
(grunting)
Anne: Phew. Think we could set up some shade out here, Hop Pop?
Hop Pop: Great suggestion, Anne.
Anne: Thanks, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: And over there, I kept a small version of your swimming hole.
Polly: (laughing)
Hop Pop: Oh, and best of all, no more pit of fire.
Sprig: Thanks, Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Thank you, Jeremy. Hmm. Nope. Hmm. Nope. Hmm. This one's a maybe.
