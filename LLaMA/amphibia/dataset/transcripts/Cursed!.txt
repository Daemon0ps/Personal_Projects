What kind of evil person would live in a place like this?
(all gasp)
Hello, children.
(all gasping) Barry?
(laughs) Enjoying the curse I put on you?
Why, Barry? Why?
Why? I'll tell you why!
Surely you remember barging into me at the market yesterday?
Spilling my entire stock of blue moon berries
that only grow once every ten years.
They were priceless!
I played it cool and was sweet
because my image is half my business.
I may look nice,
but I'm petty and vengeful on the inside.
Yeah, that was our bad. Looks can be deceiving. We get it.
Ah, right, right. The lesson thing. Barry, we're sorry.
Please lift the curse.
You can't see it really, but I'm begging on my knees.
(coos)
Hmm, let me think. Never!
Not only am I petty, but I'm very unforgiving.
As a curse wielder myself, this abuse of magic offends me.
Hmm? Oh, goodness.
You should never curse someone unless they really deserve it.
And, buddy, you deserve it!
(gasps, whimpers)
Ah! Two can play at that game.
-Ha! -(grunts)
(both gasping, grunting)
(barrel squawks)
(growling)
(both grunting)
Ah! My last curse! (growls)
I'm out! What do we do?
Give me a hand. You mean literally?
Or figuratively? Ow!
Ow. What the heck?
(Barry exclaims)
Gotcha!
-Oh, dear. -Ha!
(explosion)
And that's how you fix a door.
(explosion)
Good job.
(coughing, squawks)
Oh, no. My beautiful body.
(all coughing)
We're back to normal! She turned the curses back on him!
Maddie, you did it! I can talk!
All right, you crazy kids bested me.
Now go on, turn me back.
Nothing doing. You're way too dangerous.
(caws) What? You can't just leave me like this.
Aw, come on, Maddie. We did him wrong.
(sighs) Fine. I'll change him back.
But for a price.
(Sprig) Any chance we could get some of this candy?
(Maddie) No way.
(caws) Good-bye, Kurt.
I'm not sure if all this was a blessing
or a curse. (caws)
It was literally a curse, Anne.
Thanks for helping us, Maddie.
And sorry the engagement had to end like this.
Friends?
Friends.
Whoa! I can't wait to hang out.
(owl hoots)
(snoring, croaking)
(glugs) Meh.
(gasps)
What, you got a better way to eat ants off the floor?
Sheesh.
