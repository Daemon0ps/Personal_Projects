Anne: Those newts and toads are wearing Andrias armor. How could anyone choose to be on Andrias's side?
Sprig: Ugh, those traitors!
Anne: Wait a second. Who's that?
(both) Huh?
Please, kind soldiers, I've twisted my wee ankle and could use some help.
(gasps) Hey, you okay there, little guy?
(drinking)
(screaming)
(soldiers scream)
Wow! Rebel newts!
Awesome. Let's see if they'll join us.
(bandits growl)
Whoa! We're on the same side!
(Tritonio chuckles) I'm on no one's "side" but my own!
Anne: Wait. I know that voice. Tritonio. I should have known.
Well, well, well, if it isn't two of my best pupils. Still have my family sword, Anne?
Why don't you come over here and find out?
Charming. Well, we had a great "ha ha" catching up, but we're in a hurry. Lil Louise, relieve these two of theire supplies.
Typical. The world is falling apart, and you're still just looking out for yourself.
Mr. Tritonio!
How'd I do?
Excellent, my little JoJo Potato!
Ooh, and I heard those soldiers say there's gonna be
an ever bigger caravan passing through the woods at three o'clock.
Ah, great recon work, JoJo.
But Mr. Tritonio,
how will we get past the giant, collared beasts that guard the caravan?
Ugh, not those things again. They were such a pain last time.
Collared beasties, eh?
(scoffs) They're easy to take down once you know the trick.
Ah! So you've dealt with them before?
What am I saying? Of course you have!
You are the smartest, bravest pupils I've ever had!
You're buttering us up so we'll help you.
And it's working!
Come on, Anne. Let's help them!
Fine. But only if you promise to join the Resistance afterwards.
Done! And no backstabbing,
double-crossing or other such deception.
You wound me, Anne!
Come my friends. To the secret hideout!
Wait. Before we go, what's up with the tights?
Reduces friction. We run faster.
(grunting)
And we look amazing.
(merry band) Amazing!
I shouldn't have asked.
(jig playing)
So, why do they call you Lil Louise?
You're gigantic!
That's the joke.
(chews) Eh, I don't get it.
(Tritonio) And voila! Hmm?
We ride away from the caravan, victorious.
Wow. You have a real talent for strategy.
Too bad you're a no-good, backstabbing scallywag.
You'd be a scallywag too, if you grew up like me.
I was born a street urchin, no family, no one to look out for me.
(squeals)
I learned to survive by joining whatever street crew I crossed paths with.
But alas, living on the street
meant loyalty was thin. (cackling)
(whispers, indistinct)
(whistling)
Young Tritonio: Oh!
Jerry: Oh, you okay, little guy?
Jerry: Hey! What are you doin'?
(coins jingling)
Jerry: Get back here!
Young Tritonio: Wait for me!
(bandits chuckle) (jail cell closes)
Tritonio: (narrating) When things get bad, it's always everyone for themselves.
Anne: You're telling me, if push came to shove, you'd even leave these guys in the dust?
(merry band) Ooh! (whistling)
It is tha law of the streets: no loyalties, no attachment.
Ah, it is time.
The caravan shall be passing through in mere minutes.
Let's go!
Hey, slither brains! The dum-dum convention is two miles that way.
That is so rude.
Guards!
(hissing)
Catch us if you can.
(hissing)
Hey, who's up there? (shouts)
(whistles)
(Lil Louise) Now let's see what kinda loot we just scored.
(cackling) Ha ha, ha ha, gotcha, gotcha.
(gasps) It's a sting!
No!
Tritonio, you have to help them!
Farewell, my friends.
No! Dang it.
(shouts)
(owl hoots)
(sighs)
Tritonio, come on! We can still save them.
And risk capture ourselves?
No can do, kids.
The rules of the street, remember?
No attachments. No regrets.
But what about the Resistance? You said y--
Oh, come on, Sprig. You know I was never going to do that.
Sheesh. Okay. Dang.
Dios mio! (Anne) Look, dude.
If you wanna abandon your friends,
who you clearly adore, that's your call.
But it kills me to see you leave like this.
If you grew up how I did...
I get that. We do what we need to do to survive.
But I gotta say, for a "master thief," I'm disappointed in you.
-How so? -You're leaving the best loot in the world on the table.
Friendship, comrades, someone to count on.
By throwing those things away, you're only robbing yourself.
Come on, Sprig. We have a very merry band to save.
Right behind you.
Later, Tritonio.
(sighs)
This way!
There they are.
In the name of the King, I find you guilty of disturbing the peace.
To which there is only one punishment.
Hey, ya metal freaks! Permission to approach the bench?
(battle cry)
Voila! (all gasp)
(all battle cry)
Order! Order!
There will be order in my court!
(all) Huh?
Oh, no.
Deploying corporal punishment!
(screams)
(gasps)
No amnesty for minors!
(screams)
(shouts)
Justice is half blind!
(all gasp)
(whinnies)
(Anne, Spring) Tritonio!
Mr. Tritonio, you came back!
But what about the rules of the streets?
Ha! You think I, Tritonio, give a fig for rules?
This court holds you in contempt!
Merry band, to me!
(all) Righto!
(roars)
Legal systems failing.
(screams)
Gotcha!
(merry band cheering)
Three cheers for the greatest newt of them all!
Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!
Toss me higher! Higher, I say!
Our hero!
(chattering)
(chuckling)
Some victory gruel, senora?
Thanks, Tritonio. So, what happened to "no loyalties"?
Uh, I just happened to be passing by,
and my arrow flew out of my bow!
What are the odds? Mm-hmm.
Face it, Big T. It feels good to have someone's back.
(all laughing) Yeah, maybe.
Listen. Being on your own may have worked before,
but the fate of Amphibia rests on whether we can defeat Andrias.
Yeah! The Rebellion could really use folks like you on our side.
Sasha keeps saying we need help with our battle strategy.
And who's better at strategy than you?
(scoffs) I know you're just buttering me up so I'll help you.
Well, I learned from the best.
I gotta say, uh,
you're not the same girl I met all those months ago.
All right. We're in!
Henceforth the Rebellion shall be our new crew.
(cheering)
(Anne) Good news, Sasha!
We just recruited the top newt strategist. That's awesome!
Now come follow me, Hop Pop just found something really interesting.
Oh, there you are.
So I, uh...
I got lost while looking for the bathroom
and found this strange-looking door.
There's no telling what could be in there.
Trouble is, we can't figure out how to open it.
There's no knob or handle.
Just this like, book-sized slot.
Book-sized?
Hop Pop, have you tried sliding the family tome into it?
The one that had the Calamity Box drawings inside?
It's worth a shot. Lemme go get it!
(gears whirring)
(rumbling)
(all gasp)
Hmm.
It says...
nothing! It's blank.
Well, this is disappointing.
Our family sure was mysterious.
