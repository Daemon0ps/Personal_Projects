We've finally made it. The Misty Moors.
Time for the Moss Man summoning ritual.
Summoning ritual?
(chanting gibberish)
Uh... Are you sure this is gonna work?
(gasps) Butterflies!
Oi! Where are you going? I'm only halfway done.
(panting)
(gasps)
Oh.
Whoa.
Hmm?
(groans)
(low growling)
(gasping)
(screaming)
-Quick! After it. -Oh, right.
(panting) Wait!
No! Wait.
No.
(panting)
(panting) Where'd it go?
Oh, dang mist!
We lost him again.
We were so close.
I just can't believe it's actually real.
I know, right? Wait, what?
I thought it was a myth. I mean, it's preposterous.
But you-- I don't-- What?
So you took me all the way out here based on a lie?
Yeah. I mean, we had fun, though, didn't we?
That's not the point. I could've easily gone back with no proof.
And then everyone would think I was like you.
What's so bad about being like me?
Wally...
Oh, woof.
Wally. I didn't-- (sighs)
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
It's cool you don't care what people think about you.
And I'm glad we came out here together.
-You mean it? -Totally.
Clap it, pull it back, fist bump...
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, no. Maybe... -Um...
-Yeah? Is that right? -It was... something like that? Yeah?
Now let's get a pic of that Moss Man. Together.
Oh! Look!
Huh? (yells) There it goes.
We gotta hoof it.
(both panting)
(Wally) Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
Huh?
(low purr)
Good thing I did bouldering club in school.
(grunting)
One hand in front of the other, Wally.
(grunts)
Oh! My iconic hat.
(grunts, gasps)
(low growling)
(chuckles) Perfect.
Yo, Wally, you almost up here?
Yep. And I think I'm really starting
-to get the hang of this. -(cracking)
(yells)
-Wally! -(screams)
(grunting)
Wally! Hold on, I'm coming.
No. I'll be fine. Just take the picture!
(growling)
(yelling)
(grunts)
I got you, buddy.
Thanks. Did you get the picture?
Not yet. Come on.
One, two, three.
(screams)
Upsy-daisy.
(sighs) It's gone.
The trail's gone too.
You lost your one chance to get proof
and it's all my fault.
Now everyone's gonna think you're as loony as I am.
You know what? I'm good with that.
Wait, really? What a turnaround.
We know what we saw.
And a good friend once told me
it doesn't matter what other people think of you.
That's a good line. Would your friend mind if I used it?
It was you, Wally.
(cackles) Yeah, I know.
Or was it?
You goofball.
-(screaming) -Wally!
So there we were, our bodies ravaged.
Hanging on the edge of the cliff,
the beastie staring down at us, lickin' its mossy chops.
Any proof?
Absolutely not.
-(all murmuring) -They're two peas in a pod, these loons.
-Eh, tough crowd. -Can't please everyone.
Well, best be heading off.
 Oh, there once was a lass Named Anne the Fair 
 She put up a front And played her part 
 But soon enough Touched this loon's heart 
Anne! We heard people at Stumpy's saying you're as weird as Wally.
You must be pretty upset.
(scoffs) Honestly, guys, I don't mind.
You don't have to be strong for us.
Let it out, girl.
No, seriously. I'm fine.
Shh. Poor thing.
(yells)
I'm One-Shoed Anne!
(Polly) She's deranged!
