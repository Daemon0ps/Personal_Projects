Sprig: Ah, Harvest Day. My favorite holiday.
Polly: I'm hungry just thinking about it.
Anne:: I get it. Frog Thanksgiving. You even have a turkey.
(shrieks)
Anne: (shudders) Eh, who am I kidding? I'll eat it. Harvest Day! I'm all in!
Hop Pop: Here, Anne. How 'bout you put these turnips "all in" our display?
Anne: All right, all right.
-(hammering)
Anne: Huh? Go Farmers? What's that all about?
The big bugball game, of course.
Every year, Wartwood plays a friendly game of bugball.
Farmers-- That's us-- versus the Townies.
Polly: And every year, the Townies destroy us! It's humiliating.
And to top it off, the losers have to wear these ridiculous costumes for a whole week.
(gobbling)
Those outfits are so itchy.
Anne: Whew, tough break, you guys. Hey, do you think I can make this?
(grunts)
Anne: Ha! (dabs) Three-for-three, baby.
(croaks)
Anne, where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Learn? I don't know if you've noticed, but I have natural athletic ability.
(fanfare, cheering)
You'd be perfect for bugball.
If you join our team, we might actually win!
Win? (laughs) Not in a million years!
Hello, Farmers.
Allow me to introduce this year's Townie team.
First, we got Lydia, four time frog-lympian.
-Olaf, who transferred from state. -(exhales)
Frog Jordan, who I literally bribed to join.
-What's up? -And last but not least, Toadie,
who is surprisingly good at this.
Mm-hmm, yes. Scary stuff, huh?
Be careful you Farmers don't soil yourselves on the field.
(laughs) Did you hear that? Soil?
-'Cause they're farmers. -(laughter)
(all groan)
Sorry, Mayor.
Farmers are gonna win this year because they've got me.
Cool!
We're gonna beat you and your fancy Townie team.
Well, I'll certainly enjoy watching you try.
Townies, move out.
Anne: We can still see you!
No, you can't!
Huh, guess I should probably learn how to play bugball.
-Oh, yeah, probably. -Yeah, that's a good idea.
(shrieking)
Archie: (panting)
Polly: What's up?
(grunting efforts)
Welcome to Team Farmers.
This is the playing field.
Those skulls are the goals.
And this is the bugball.
Anne: Oh, how cute. It's shaped like a real-- Ah! Real bug. It's a real bug. Got it. So we just put the bug in the goal, right?
Seems pretty simple.
Oh, there's more to it than that.
(straining effort)
Hop Pop: Now, see here. You got your shooters-- That's you and Croaker-- And you got your passers, me and Chuck. That's Chuck, by the way.
Chuck: I grow tulips.
Anne: Good to know.
And lastly, on defense, there's Sprig.
-(grunts) -'Cause he's not really great at the shooting part. Never scored a point in his life.
(squeals, deflates)
That's 'cause you never give me a chance.
Mm-hmm. Anyway, Anne, it says here
the most important thing about bugball is teamwork.
Uh-buh-buh-buh- buh-buh-buh.
Toss that playbook away,
'cause all we need is the "Pass it to Anne" play.
Huh!
Yuck! I don't know, Anne.
You're good, but the Townies are hard-core.
Yeah, Anne, I think the team should really--
Look, I don't usually do "team sports".
I do "me sports", like tennis.
Me sports, I win.
You guys wanna win, right?
Yeah. More than anything.
I grow tulips.
Well, then, trust me.
I got this.
-Ooh! Uh! -Whoopsie daisy.
Beat it, Farmers. We're here to practice.
Hey, Farmers have the field for another hour!
Oh, yeah? Well, our schedule says different.
Oh! (grunts) Ah!
(growls) (shouts)
Unless you'd like to scrimmage against us.
Eh, I think we need a little more practice before--
You're on! What?
Game on!
(Anne) Hop Pop, gimme!
Oh, okay, Anne.
Heh! (growls)
-Huh! -(laughs)
(crowd cheering) Okay. Let's try that again.
Anne, pass!
It's all good. I got this!
(groans) Again!
Anne, over here! I'm open, I'm open!
-(Mrs. Croaker) Anne, Anne! Over here! -I'm open!
(grunts) I'm taking the shot!
Huh?
-Mm. -(Anne groans)
(grunts) (Anne) Dang it.
Huh! (Anne) Dang it!
-(Anne) Dang it! Again! -(record scratch)
Yeah, no, that's the end of the game.
What? (Mayor) Field's all yours, Farmers.
Looks like we don't even need to practice.
(laughter) Ugh.
What the heck happened out there?
(sighs) This is why I hate team sports.
I'm always outnumbered. Outnumbered?
Look around you, Anne.
You have an entire team to back you up.
You're not the only one who can shoot. I grow tulips.
(sighs) In tennis, if I'm losing, I just play harder.
But this is different. I don't know how to win this.
Not you, Anne, we.
The only way we win is to work as a team.
What do you say, Anne?
Well...
Yeah, Anne, what do you say?
(groans) I guess I'll give it a shot.
That's the spirit! Yahoo!
Tulips! We can work with that!
(blows whistle)
(growls)
(laughs)
(cheering)
Yeah! Huh!
(gags)
Ah, refreshing.
(groans weakly)
-Ha! -(cheering)
All right, Anne, we got one final exercise for you.
True teamwork is all about trust.
Just listen to your team, and we'll guide you.
Uh, okay.
Dodge left!
Jump! Huh!
Now, stop. Turn slowly.
Can you hear me, Anne? Can you hear your dear, old Hop Poppy?
Yes, I hear you, Hop Pop.
Do you trust me, Anne?
I trust you.
Now, shoot!
(cheering) You did it, Anne!
You know what, guys? This teamwork stuff is actually pretty cool.
That's the spirit. You're finally a team player, Anne.
We can't lose! Tongue five, everybody!
(straining) Okay, I'll just do this.
(announcer) Ladies and gentle frogs,
-welcome to the annual big bugball game! -(cheering)
Give it up for Team Townies! Bring it on!
And the Farmers! We got it, we got it.
All right, frogs, listen up.
I want a good, clean game, right?
Now let's play bugball!
Farmers, are we ready?
(all agree) Tulips.
Everybody cover Anne.
(scoffs) She's never gonna pass it.
(whistle blows)
-Huh? -(all growl)
(laughs)
What the-- Huh?
-Whoo-hoo! -(cheering)
Well, looks like we got ourselves a challenge.
(laughs) (grunts)
(crowd cheering)
Toadie throw!
Over here, Hop Pop. (grunts)
This is it, folks, with only one minute left in the game,
whoever scores the next point wins! (laughs)
(all panting)
Come on, gang! We can win this thing!
Townies, huddle up.
Now their teamwork may have improved,
but Anne is still the only reason those yokels have gotten this far!
Looks like we may need to resort to drastic measures
to win this game, know what I mean?
By drastic measures, do you mean switching our focus
from the outcome to just having fun?
No, Frog Jordan. I mean cheat! Cheat!
Initiate plan "Last Resort".
All right, let's keep it clean, now.
(grunts) Sprig! Huh?
(laughs) (shouts)
My peepers! (whistle blows)
Blinding powder, eh? Well, that's a foul, as in foul play.
Toadie, you're disqualified!
Thanks for taking one for the team, Toadie.
By the time that powder wears off, we'll have won this game.
Oh, no! Our star player!
Well, saute my legs and serve me for lunch. We're done.
Never! We've done this before, and we're gonna do it again.
The trust exercise?
Uh, news flash, that didn't involve actual opponents.
There's no way we can pull this off.
Guys, you taught me that teamwork can make the impossible possible.
Also, I'm not actually crying, my eyes just won't stop watering.
Well, shoot, I'm crying, 'cause that was beautiful.
Anyway, let's do this.
(all) Yeah!
What? You're gonna play blindfolded?
Well, now I've seen everything. (laughter)
(laughs) That was funny.
Anne, go!
Jump! (grunts)
Dodge right! Dodge left!
Do a cartwheel!
Yeah, nice!
(together) Stop! Shoot!
Stop her!
(grunts)
Did I do it?
(yells in slow motion)
(slowed) No!
(buzzer sounds)
(crowd gasps)
(gasps)
(panting)
-(grunts) -(horn blares)
That's the game. Farmers win.
(cheering)
(groaning)
No! (blubbering)
Oh, oh, oh.
-(screaming) -(turkey gobbling)
Dude! You did it! Your first goal!
How's it feel? Amazing. I feel like a living god!
You did it, Anne. You did it!
No, we did it. This wouldn't have happened without my teammates.
Know what else wouldn't happen without teammates?
(Anne screams) (laughter)
Get them off me! Get them off me!
Sorry! (all munching)
Oh, this is worse!
