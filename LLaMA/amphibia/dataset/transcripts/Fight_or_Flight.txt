Thanks, everyone!
I just have to bust her out of a mountain-top fortress,
so I shouldn't be gone long.
I still think this is a terrible idea.
What if we save her, and she tears you to shreds?
Domino 2 would never hurt me.
I just know. I feel it in my heart.
(sighs) All right.
Well, count me in.
Thanks, dude. Appreciate the help.
I mean, someone's gotta watch your back when this goes horribly wrong.
(Anne) We really need to work on your pep talks.
(all meow)
Wally, you take first watch. And be careful.
Aye, aye, ma'am. I'll guard the prisioners with me life.
If you little blighters know what's good for you,
you won't try anything! (meows)
Oh, no! No! Stay back. Stay back!
Stay back! (echoes)
Take a look. Another one of King Andrias's robot bases.
(Sprig) They're isung the moths to generator power.
And look! Mind-control collars.
(buzzer rings)
(powers down)
Okay, here's the plan:
We'll wait for the moths to fall sleep,
and then we sneak in and free my baby precious.
Anne, there are dozens of moths. How are you gonna find--
She's right there.
Oh. Huh. Nice.
(Anne) Now come on. Let's motor.
I'll call you Cali-coco, and Nutgrass, and Josey-Pie,
and of course, little Wally Jr.!
(Mrs. Croaker) Wally?
What's going on in here?
(chuckles) Nothing!
I'm just, uh, passing time with my accordion!
(meowing)
Wally, that...
is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
Aw, lemme hold one!
(meows, purrs) (chuckles) Hey, they're friendly.
(chuckles) And this one is a...
(hisses) ...cute little warrior!
Get off me, you disgusting, little...
dear.
Oh.
You fools!
Quick, shield your eyes!
Don't look at 'em! That's how they get ya!
(meows)
(man vocalizing)
"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."
(moths snoring)
(sniffing)
(grunts)
(snoring)
Shh. Wait there.
Come on, stupid thing.
Uh-oh. (roars)
Oh!
Stop right-- (screams)
(growls)
Anne, look out! Run!
(roars) No, I can't leave her!
(Anne screams)
Anne, get away!
No. She'll remember me. I know it.
Come on, girl.
(roars)
Or maybe I'm wrong. (screams)
(purrs) (laughs)
Ow!
I don't believe this. She does remember you!
Huh. Big win for blind faith.
(meows)
Domino 2,
you didn't forget me.
(purring) Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl?
(sniffles) Wow. This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my--
(growls) I'm about to get eaten, aren't I?
(gulps)
(shrieking)
Sprig! Hang on, buddy!
Okay, how do we do this?
Domino 2, up, up and awa--
(screams)
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, no!
Ah, nuts.
(grunts, screams)
(roars)
(strains)
Whoa!
Whoo!
(screams)
Gotcha! Now let's get outta here!
(clanks)
What's wrong, girl?
(coos)
You're right. We can't just leave them here.
I mean, we could.
Sprig. Okay, okay.
(grunting)
(meows)
Looks like we did it.
(screams) Sprig!
(screams)
(screams)
-(Sprig screams) -(moths meow)
There is definitely not enough me to go around!
Sprig, no!
(roars)
(groans)
Th-- Thanks.
Why did they listen to her?
No way.
Sprig, Marcy told me about animals like this.
Domino 2 must be the alpha moth!
So that means, if we've tamed Domino...
Yep! We've tamed 'em all!
Whoo-hoo! Follow me, everyone!
Yeah!
(kittens meowing)
Oh, Lenny Long Bottom, you filled the spider-sized hole in my heart.
No one's ever gonna take these babies away from us.
Oh, no! Look!
You stay away from them!
You want 'em, you gotta get through us!
Hey, everyone! You could put your weapons down. They're with us now!
(all) Huh?
With us?
Well, guys, looks like we just got air calvary!
(all cheering)
