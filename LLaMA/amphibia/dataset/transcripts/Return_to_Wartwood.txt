Hop Pop: (inhales) Ah, how I miss the swamp air. The aroma of grass, a whisper of manure, and just a pinch of humidity. Do you feel that humidity, Anne?
(Anne's hair is shown to be very frazzled from the humidity.)
Anne: A pinch.
Polly: (gasps, pops out of Anne's hair) I see it! I see it! I can see Wartwood!
(gasps) Whoa.
Sprig:  Wartwood, O mighty Wartwood 
 I sing to thee Our noble history 
-  A newt told a toad... 
Mrs. Croaker: Hey, I know that irritating voice.
 But don't let them escape poverty 
Mrs. Croaker: The Plantars are back! Get out here, everyone! It's the Plantars!
- Ooh! - Oh, hi!
Hiya, folks!
- Hoppy! - Sylvia!
Come here, city boy!
Any luck finding a way back to your world, Anne?
Not yet. But we're whittling away at it.
(chuckles) That wood reference was for me.
Well, if it isn't the Plantars! Buba-dee buba-dee bup. Haven't seen you lot for a long time.
Uh, definitely didn't see you on your trip.
Whatever you say, "Walliam."
(clears throat)
Sprig: Uh, hey, Felicia. Where's Ivy?
Felicia: Oh, she said she had something more important to do.
Sprig: More important?
Felicia: Something about an...
Ivy: Ambush!
(Ivy tackles Sprig)
Sprig: Uh... hi.
Ivy: Hey, you.
(all) Aww! Isn't it cute?
Toadie: Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Mayor Toadstool: Just simmer down now! Come on, simmer down. Market stops for no one. Y'all can welcome back the Plantars after business hours.
Stumpy: Oh! How about we all meet at my restaurant tonight? Have a town dinner for the Plantars.
Hop Pop: We're in. I can't wait for some authentic swamp cooking!
Stumpy: And I can't wait for that Newtopian coral hand fitment. Thanks for pickin' it up for me.
Mrs. Croaker: Say, if we're all gonna be together anyway, why not bring all the gifts from our wish list?
(excited chattering)
Sprig: Gifts?
Anne: Wish list?
Hop Pop: Great idea, Mrs. Croaker.
(loud yawn)
Polly: Can we go home, Hop Papa? I'm so "sweeeepy."
Hop Pop: Of course, my sweet baby child. Okay, here we go! Come on, kids!
Okay, bye.
(grunting)
Anne: Do you want this one?
Sprig: No, no, all yours.
(tapping)
Anne: What the heck is going on?
Hop Pop: Aha! Found it.
Polly: So, uh, remember when Hop Pop and I went to pick up the Fwagon?
Polly (narrating): Well, on our way back, Mrs. Croaker asked if we could pick her up a new romance novel while we were in the city.
Hop Pop (narrating): Before we knew it, everybody was asking for stuff. So we made a wish list. We hid the list in a special place so we wouldn't forget. And then we forgot it.
Anne: What?
Polly: I'm so sorry, you guys. Please don't get mad.
Anne: (to Polly) Oh, no, no, no. It's okay, Polly. You're just a baby. (to Hop Pop) But you! I cannot believe you forgot about something so important, Hop Pop!
Hop Pop: Look, I'm sure we can find a way to bury this so no one finds out.
Anne: Nope. Lying will only make it worse. I feel like we've learned that lesson by now.
Sprig: Well, one thing's for sure. We have to lie.
Anne: Preach! Wait, what?
Sprig: Ivy asked for a red sunshell from the Newtopian coast. To match my blue moonshell.
Anne: Oh!
Sprig: She can't find out, Anne. What if she gets mad? What if she thinks I don't like her? The relationship will be over before it starts!
Anne: (grunts) Fine! I'll do it for Sprivy. No way I'm letting that ship sink.
Great. Now, let's put our heads together and come up with a plan.
Anne: Oh, yeah, and we'd better hurry, or you might forget.
It was one time, Anne!
Hop Pop: Bye, Chuck. Thanks for watching the house, Chuck.
Chuck: I grew tulips.
Okay, so we agree on the concept.
Fake empty gift boxes that get tragically destroyed by some kind of monster.
But what monster? Nothing too dangerous.
We don't want anyone to actually get hurt.
Sprig: How about this? The Chicka-lisk. A beast that eats gold and treasure, doesn't eat Amphibians, won't attack unless threatened, and can be called to any area with a ritual.
Where'd you get that book? This cover made out of skin?
Sprig: Maddie gave it to me.
Aw, that's nice.
I gotta say, this Chicka-lisk is pretty perfect.
Gifts get eaten, no one gets hurt, and we don't get blamed.
We all okay with using ancient Eldritch magics? Sure. Why not?
Gotta do what we gotta do. I'd be mad if we didn't!
Great! Now to collect all the materials we need for the ritual.
First, we need the horn of a sky goat,
whose arcane note pierces the air.
(goat bleats)
Sprig: Then we need cursed obsidian to amplify the dark energy.
Anne: Finally, we need candles for that evil ritual vibe.
Polly: Wait, that's not in the book.
Anne: Trust me, it's a thing. Oooh! They have "campfire!"
(screaming)
Hop Pop: Play the forbidden note.
(inhales deeply)
(horn blares)
Hop Pop: Corrupt its sacred message.
Hop Pop: All righty then! Now, who wants Stumpy's?
All (except Hop Pop): Whoo!
(upbeat music playing) Wow.
Chuck: I like tulips.
Mrs. Croaker: You don't say?
Can we open the gifts soon? I'm itching for that hand.
Not literally. No feelin' in it.
(chuckles) Presents seem like an "end of the night" thing.
Why rush it?
Sprig: And I barely got out of the ant queen's stomach alive! I'm still coughing up acid. (laughs) Blegh!
Ivy: I'm so jealous! At least when I look at my sunshell, it'll be like a piece of me was there with you.
Sprig: But, uh, end of the day, it's just a shell, right?
Ivy: It's our shell. I'm really happy you found me one.
(clears throat)
(creature shrieking)
Sprig: Oh, thank frog. Finally.
Hmm?
(chorus)  Chicka-lisk, Chicka-lisk 
 Watch out for Chicka-lisk 
 Chicka-lisk, Chicka-lisk  (shrieking)
 Watch out for Chicka-lisk 
What is that thing?
Maddie: Chicka-lisk, the Storm Bearer. It's an honor to see him. You know, before he kills us.
Anne and the Plantars: Oh, no! Who could have predicted this?
Don't overdo it.
(squawking)
(shrieking)
What the heck is it saying? No idea.
Its language is older than written history.
Oh, no! It is eating the presents.
We should probably leave it alone till it's finished.
No way!
You guys did something nice for us.
Are we gonna let some chicken get away with this? Would the Plantars?
(all) No!
Well, then, come on! Let's save those presents!
For the Plantars!
(all) For the Plantars!
Sprig: Wait, no, Ivy!
Hop Pop: Uh-oh.
Anne: I can't believe it's finally my turn to say this, but... told you so! Boom!
Ivy: Eat this, you chump!
(shrieks)
(grunts)
Loggle: I'm Loggle.
(screams)
Sprig! Let's spatchcock this chicken!
Aye, aye!
Wait, guys, we gotta work together!
Who knows what this thing can do!
(screaming)
Holy moly! Cool!
Maddie! Can you cure them?
Uh, yeah, sure. I should have enough antidote for everyone... probably.
Good enough.
For Wartwood!
(all) For Wartwood!
You have beautiful eyes.
Split up! We gotta surround it! Okay!
Oh, my go... Oh, wait.
Aim for the eyes, children!
(screaming)
Yee-hah!
Anne: Nice! Using Toadie's stone body as a shield.
Mayor Toadstool: Wait, he's stone?
Mrs. Croaker: Upsy-daisy, Archie.
(grunting)
(shrieking)
This thing's unbeatable!
Mayor Toadstool: Nothing's unbeatable! Everyone, Chicka-lisk formation!
Toadie: We have a formation for this?
Mayor Toadstool: We have a formation for everything!
(all grunting and into their formation)
Mayor Toadstool: Come on, Anne!
(Anne joins with the Chicka-Lisk formation up top as the Chicka-Lisk looks at them left and right with the eyes)
Chicka-Lisk (subtitled while crowing): Okay that's just offensive, you guys. Chicka-Lisk, out!
 Chicka-lisk 
(the Chicka-Lisk then disappears)
(cheering) We did it!
Finger lickin' gone!
But it destroyed all the gifts you worked so hard to bring back for us!
If only we had fought harder. I guess we let you guys down.
(crowd murmuring) It's a shame.
Polly: Me and Hop Pop forgot the wish list and didn't get you guys anything!
All: What?
Can you believe it? The nerve of it all.
Mayor Toadstool: Why am I not surprised? Typical Plantars. Giant monsters, property damage, putting the entire town in danger.
(Anne and the Plantars look down in shame.)
Mayor Toadstool (chuckles): I gotta admit, I missed it!
Hear! Hear! Me too.
(all) Huh?
Mayor Toadstool: Things have been really boring without you four causing mayhem and learning emotional lessons.
Wait, so you don't care that we lied
and summoned an elder god to cover it up?
Stumpy: Not especially. We're just glad you're back.
Sprig: Ivy, I'm sorry I didn't get you a red sunshell. (Ivy friendly punches Sprig) Ow!
Ivy: You big dummy! It's just a shell. You can make it up to me by finally taking me on a date.
(Ivy kisses Sprig on the cheek as Sprig gets a happy reaction)
Anne: (squealing)
(Polly then grabs Anne)
Polly: Okay, we're done here.
(Sprig while being still and happy faints while Maddie throws the potion on him thinking he's a statue)
