Felicia: My little girl's a woman.
Ivy: Mom!
Sprig: (gulps)
Hop Pop: All right, boy, go get that lucrative business relationship. I mean, romantic relationship. (chuckles) Saved it.
Sprig: (squeaking) Hey.
Ivy: Hi.
Sprig: Uh... these are for you.
Ivy: Oh. Thanks.
Sprig: So...you're looking like a... girl frog.
Ivy: Oh, okay. I like your, uh, collar.
Felicia: (sighs) I'm so happy we agreed on this merger, Hopadiah. That Sprig of yours looks like a hard worker.
Hop Pop: Like we agreed, you'll get Sprig to work at your restaurant, and I'll get the seeds to those Sundew vegetables.
Felicia: Agreed.
Anne: This is so exciting. I wonder what their ship name will be. Ivig? Sprigivy?
Polly: What are you even saying?
Hop Pop: Shh! Let's watch our little love doves fly. Love doves are birds that mate for life.
Anne: I got it.
Albus Duckweed: Excuse me, everybody, but I hear we have a couple of love doves here tonight. Ivy Sundew and Sprig Plantar. Whoo! A big hand for them. Come on, let me hear it. Hopadiah Plantar says, "Sprig, don't mess this up for us." And Felicia Sundew would like Ivy to "have a great courtship. Wink." It says "wink" here. "Love, Mom." All right, then. Hit it, boys!
(music playing)
(both chuckle nervously)
(both grunting)
Sprig: There we go.
Ivy: I had no idea you felt this way about me, Sprig.
Sprig: Oh, sure. Didn't you know two-thirds of all mates start with souls? Ah! I mean, two-thirds of all souls start with...(sighs) I can't do this. I'm really sorry, Ivy. I-- I don't want to date you. Everyone just convinced me this was a good idea.
Ivy: Oh, thank goodness! I only went along because I didn't want to hurt you. Also 'cause my mom forced me.
Sprig: Ha! Parents, am I right? What do you say we ditch this thing and go watch some fireflies? They're in season.
Ivy: (laughs) After you, friend.
Sprig: Why, thank you, friend.
(both laughing)
Anne: Ooh-la-la. The little love doves are sneaking off into the woods. You know what that means.
Felicia: It means they're abandoning the ritual! If those two don't finish that dance...
Hop Pop: Then this courtship will be ruined! Along with my financial security!
Anne: Wait, what? We cannot let them waste this chance. They say nine out of ten people stay up at night regretting missed romantic opportunities. Nine out of ten!
Hop Pop: Come on, gang. Let's get this merger back on track.
Polly: Uh, counterpoint. Why don't we just leave them alone?
Felicia: Ridiculous.
Hop Pop: Not a chance.
Anne: I'm way too invested right now.
(grunting)
Sprig: Wow. Man, this is way better than that stuffy old dance. Right, Ivy? Ivy? Ivy?
Ivy: Ambush!
Sprig: Ha ha!
Ivy: Oh, no, you don't.
Sprig: Ha ha ha!
Ivy: Come back here! This'll be your grave!
Sprig: That's, uh...That's pretty dark.
Hop Pop: Hmm. Where are those dang kids?
(wings flapping)
(bird screeches)
Hop Pop: What's that?
Anne: Huh?
Felicia: They're beautiful.
Polly: Just look at them.
Hop Pop: Love doves. Don't move or we're dead.
Anne: What? I thought they were all romantic and mate for life.
Hop Pop: Yeah, and they spend that life massacring all living things.
(both coo, shriek)
(all scream)
(squawking)
(all scream)
Hop Pop: Beautiful. (scream)
Sprig: Hey, purple ones.
Ivy: Oh, yeah, those are babies. I read that they're purple so the moms can find them if they get lost.
Sprig: What? That's adorable.
Ivy: I know, right?
Sprig: Bleh. (screaming) What the...
Ivy: That sounded like...
(screaming)
Sprig: Our families! We gotta help them!
Ivy: Way ahead of you. Come on, let's go!
(screeching)
(all grunt)
(all gasp)
(both shriek)
Anne: We're stuck.
(both squawk)
Anne: Uh, so they're not gonna eat us?
Hop Pop: Not right away. Love doves prefer to let their prey marinate in fear first.
Felicia: (groans) Can it, Plantar. This is all your fault. If you taught your grandson proper courtship technique--
Hop Pop: My fault? It's obviously yours.
Anne: (grunts, spits) Guys, it says here that our relationships define us, and nothing else. Nothing else!
(all speaking, indistinct)
Polly: (growls) Enough! It's all your faults.
Hop Pop: Say what?
Anne: Impossible.
Polly: Zip it! The only reason we're here marinating is because you all had to play matchmaker. You two were greedy, plain and simple.
Hop Pop: Maybe a little.
Felicia: It's nuanced.
Anne: Nice. Totally innocent for once. You two should be ashamed.
Polly: Are you kidding? Sprig only went through with this because of you and this dumb magazine!
(Growling like crazy, Polly tears the magazine apart in her mouth. When she's finished, she's left heavily panting.)
Anne: Wow. I feel lighter somehow, more... free.
Sprig: Hey! We're here to rescue you.
All: Whew!
Felicia: Oh, thank frog.
Ivy: We're also here to tell you we don't want to date each other and we never will.
Hop Pop: We know. Polly set us straight.
Felicia: Look, kids, we--
Anne: Sprig, I'm so sorry.
(shrieking)
Polly: I always tell them, "Save the heartfelt apologies for when we get to safety."
Ivy: Don't worry, guys. Sprig and I are ready for combat. Right?
Sprig: Right.
Ivy: On the count of three. One, two...
Ivy: Sprig?
Sprig: Ambush! Ha ha!
(grunts)
(shrieks)
Sprig: Take that, you beautiful creature!
(squawks)
(squawks)
Sprig: Whoa!
(cooing)
Ivy: Nice ambush.
Sprig: Well, I learned from the best. Now let's finish this up.
(squawks)
(sighs)
Hop Pop: Amazing. Even in defeat, they're majestic.
(cooing)
Felicia: Come along now, Ivy. Let's get you home so I can apologize safely.
Ivy: Okay. That was fun. See ya, Sprig!
Sprig: See ya, Ivy!
Hop Pop: Sprig, next time we won't get the courtship kit out until you're good and ready. Now I can focus on finding love for Polly.
Polly: No!
Anne: Well, that's the end of that. Now you and Ivy can go back to being just friends.
Sprig: Yep.
Anne: Oh, you just fell in love with her, didn't you?
Sprig: Yeah, I just fell in love with her.
