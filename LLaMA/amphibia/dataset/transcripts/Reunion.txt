(intro)
(Three months earlier)
(Anne is biking her way to school. When she arrives, a girl approaches her while she's putting her lock on the bike rack.)
Maggie: Hey, Boobchuy! Whatcha eatin'? A puke bun? (cackles)
Anne: It's not a bun, Maggie. It's khao niew bing, a traditional Thai snack made up of rice and coconut milk. My mom made it for me because it's my birthday.
Maggie: Oh, happy birthday. Give me that!
Anne: Hey! Get your own Thai mom.
Sasha: Hey, Margot! Leave her alone! Also, nice guitar solo, Vince.
Vince: Yeah!
Maggie: Oh, yeah? Or else what?
Sasha: Or else you can forget coming to my awesome house party next week. It'll be really sad when the whole class is enjoying the pool without you.
Maggie: Aw, jeez, Sash. I was just playin'. Here.
Anne: Thanks, dude.
Sasha: No worries. You just gotta speak their language. But never mind that. Happy birthday, girl!!
Both: (Squealing)
Anne: Yes!
(School bell rings)
Sasha: Buzzkill.
Mrs. Virk: Alright, class. Today's your lucky day cause it's Frog Dissection day.
Boy 1: Gross!
(all groan)
Boy 2: Gross!
Anne: Ugh! Frogs are the worst.
Sasha: Right? Let's get outta here. (heaving) Mrs. Virk, the sight of blood... I-- I'm gonna be sick.
Mrs. Virk: Oh, dear. Anne, why don't you take Sasha to the sick room before she desecrates these beautiful frog bodies with her vomit? Thank you.
(both giggling)
Anne: Yo, Sash. Sick room's over here.
Sasha: (sighs) Forget the sick room. Forget school. Let's get out of here and celebrate your birthday in style.
Anne: Oof, skip school? I don't know, Sash--
Sasha: Anne, this is your 13th birthday. You only get one of these. So let's make it the best birthday in the history of birthdays.
Anne: Well... all right. I gotta be home by 6:00, though. My parents are throwing a big party and they really want me to be there.
Sasha: Right, right, you got it. Now let's get this thing started!
(laughter)
Sasha: Yes!
(game beeping)
(both grunting)
Anne: Whoo! Top score. (sighs) Phew!
(both giggle)
(siren wailing)
Anne: Ah!
Sasha: Whoo! Here we go.
(Anne screaming)
Sasha: Out of the way, Granny!
Anne: Whoa!
(laughing)
(Sasha whooping)
(slurping)
Anne: So that's what a unicorn tastes like. Corn syrup. (phone chimes) Huh?
(She looks at her phone. There are two messages from her mom; both say "Where are you?" and "Party starts in 15 minutes!")
Anne: Oh, shoot. It's almost 6:00. I gotta go, dude.
Sasha: Family party, right? Lame. Let me guess, a clown? With balloon animals?
Anne: (blushes) I know it's not the coolest, but this is important to them.
Sasha: Mmm-hmm. (gasps)
(phone chimes)
Sasha: Oh, my gosh. Marcy says she found the perfect gift for you downtown. (laughs) A frog music box for the frog lover. I wonder if those gems are real. (pushes Anne) Come on. Let's keep this party train rollin'. Choo-choo!
Anne: Sorry, dude, you don't understand. I really gotta go.
(Sasha becomes stern.)
Sasha: Oh, I understand, Anne. You're a good little girl who's gotta go home to her mommy and daddy. Come on. Hang out with your friends that love you.
Anne: Sasha, I'd really like to, but--
Sasha: (puts up her hand) Anne, this isn't cute anymore. We are meeting up with Marcy right now. End of discussion.
(Anne is shocked for a moment, but gives in.)
Anne: I guess it's okay if I'm a little late... (chuckles)
(Scene changes to outside, and Anne and Sasha exit the coffee shop holding hands.)
Sasha: Boom! I knew you'd change your mind.
(roaring)
(grunts)
(all screaming)
Anne: Sasha! The toads! I gotta go help my fr--
Sasha: Chill out, Anne. They're with me.
Anne: Wait, what?
Sprig: Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne!
(He and his family run over to the two girls.)
Sprig: Toads! They're everywhere. We barely slipped out while the guards were--
Polly: Holy toot, another Anne!
Anne: Oh. (chuckles) Guys, meet my bestie from back home, Sasha!
Sasha: Hey.
Anne: Sasha, meet the Plantars. This is Hop Pop.
Hop Pop: Eh.
Anne: Sprig.
Sprig: Hey, hey.
Anne: And Polly.
Polly: 'Sup.
(Sprig hops over to Sasha.)
Sprig: Hey, I'm her bestie too. I guess that makes me your bestie-in-law. (laughs)
Sasha: (unimpressed) Does it?
(Sprig's smile drops. He laughs awkwardly while coughing.)
Sprig: Did y'all feel that? (coughs)
Hop Pop: Walk it off, boy. Yes, hi, nice to meet ya. Now, can someone please tell me why there's a toad army invading Wartwood?!
Sasha: You're Hop Pop? Thought you'd be taller.
Hop Pop: Huh?
Sasha: Relax, we're not invading anything. Come on, Anne. You too, frogs. We don't want to keep Grime waiting.
Hop Pop: Captain Grime?
Sprig: The cruelest toad soldier of all time?
Polly: Here?
Sasha: Ah, he's not so bad once you get used to him. Now hurry up, nerds.
Anne: (chuckles) She's persuasive, right?
Grime: Frogs of Wartwood! We toads have come here to...
(stammering)
Grime: ...invite you to a banquet!
(toots)
Grime: The moment we heard that Anne was here, we rushed over to reunite these two friends and hold a celebration.
Sasha: Aw, come here.
All: Aw!
Hop Pop: (skeptically) Really?
Grime: Yes. Despite my rough exterior, I really am just an "old softy".
(Sasha clears throat)
(growls)
(crowd gasps)
(baby cries)
Sasha: Uh, so, what do you say, Wartwood? You ready to party back at the tower?
(frog croaks)
Mrs. Croaker: What does Anne think?
Anne: Uh... Sasha's been my friend since kindergarten. If she says it's fine, it's fine.
Sasha: Whoo! All aboard the party barge!
-(music playing)
-(excited chatter)
Wally: Two parties in one night? Whoo-hoo!
Sasha: Psst, Anne, you're with me.
(snorts)
Anne: Wow, cool. Hey, mind if the, uh, Plantars come along?
Sasha: Of course, I don't mind. The more, the merrier.
Hop Pop: First class!
Sprig: I call window seat.
(laughing)
Polly: No, me! No, me!
Hop Pop: Kids, stop pushing. Ow!
(glass breaks)
Anne: (chuckles) They're fun.
(music playing)
Frog 1: Whoo-hoo!
Frog 2: Yeah! This is fun.
Sasha: So, here we are.
Anne: Ominous.
Sasha: Oh, Percy!
(Percy rushes over.)
Percy: Yes, Commander?
Sasha: I'm gonna give Anne a quick tour. Escort these frogs to the banquet hall.
Sprig: Hey, I wanna go on the tour too.
Polly: (gasps) Me three!
Hop Pop: Come on, kids. Give Anne and her friend a chance to catch up.
Anne: Don't worry. I'll find you guys later. Go have fun in there.
Sprig: (groans) We'll try.
(The Plantar family leaves with Percy.)
Sasha: You certainly seem close with those three. What happened to, "Ew, frogs are the worst"?
Anne: They're actually pretty great once you get to know them. (chuckles) I've been living in their basement since I got here.
Sasha: A basement? Yuck. Follow me. I'm gonna show you something crazy.
(Sasha opens the door to her chamber.)
Sasha: This is where I've been living.
Anne: Hoopa de boopa! Whoa!
Sasha: Yo, Brunton. (snaps fingers)
Brunton: (speaks in a French accent) Oui, Commander?
Sasha: Bring us the usual.
Anne: Pizza? Tacos? Hamburgers? Whoa, you've got ketchup?! It just occurred to me I've been eating bugs for a month.
Brunton: Anything else, Commander?
Sasha: Run the hot water, please. For the shower.
Anne: Shower?!
(laughter)
(slurps)
Polly: So, you experiment with other weapons or are you just a spear guy?
Mrs. Croaker: One more, and one more. One more. Last one.
Sprig: Uh, hey, Hop Pop? Something's not right here.
Hop Pop: Not right, yeah, sure. Here, Sprig, load up on crab legs. These babies go fast.
Sprig: No, I mean it. Don't the toads seem a little... on edge?
Hop Pop: Eh, they're a militarized culture, Sprig. I'm not surprised they don't know how to let loose.
Sprig: Ah, forget this. I'm gonna go find Anne.
Hop Pop: Good idea. She can carry more crab legs.
Sprig: Hey, pal, I'm just gonna go for a walk, get some fresh air--
Toad Soldier 1: No! Sorry. Uh, you frogs aren't allowed to leave this room.
Sprig: We're not allowed to leave? Why's that?
Toad Soldier 1: Uh... I've said too much. Please just return to the party and remain calm.
Sprig: Remain calm. You got it, buddy.
Toad Soldier 1: Whew, thanks, kid.
Sprig: Hey, everyone! This is a sham! We're not guests! We're prisoners!
Frog 3: Prisoners?!
Mrs. Croaker: What?!
(crowd screaming)
(The Toad Soldier starts whimpering)
Anne: Wow, Sash. This is so surreal. I can't believe you're really here.
Sasha: I know, right? (sighs) And once this is over, we can finally find a way out of this crummy, gross world.
Anne: (slurping) Once... what's over?
Sasha: Oh, the rebellion.
Anne: (chuckles) The what now?
Sasha: You don't know about the rebellion? Look, I'll explain. Just promise not to freak out or anything.
Anne: O...kay.
Sasha: So you've probably already noticed that the toads in this valley have one job: to rule over the frogs. And lately, those frogs have been stepping outta line. It turns out these "rebels" have been inspired by a certain frog. You might just know him. Stood up to some tax collectors, even ran for mayor against the local toad.
(She hold up a poster, which unrolls to reveal Hop Pop.)
(Anne pulls a spit-take with her cocoa.)
Anne: (coughs) What?! Hop Pop's not a revolutionary!
(Sasha throws down a bunch of newspapers with Hop Pop's image on the front pages.)
Sasha: Doesn't matter. Word has traveled like wildfire, and we've got to make an example out of him. (takes Anne over to a window) So, the toads are just gonna feed him to that thing.
(Outside, Grime and his soldiers are struggling to keep a giant Venus fly trap under control.)
Grime: Hold her steady, boys!
(roaring)
(Anne gasps in shock.)
Sasha: Okay, here's the thing. I struck a deal with Grime. I'd help him capture Hop Pop and crush the rebellion, and Grime and his army will help us find a way home. The whole banquet trick-- My idea, obvi. Now we've got those slimy frogs right where we want them. Isn't this great?
Anne: Uh... I have to, uh... go to the roomrest, uh, the restroom. (laughs, bumps into the Sasha bust) Whoa. (stands the bust back up) Stay. BRB.
(bullet ricochets)
Sasha: (slurps) Oh, she's totally freaking out.
(crowd yelling)
Wally: I'm totally freaking out!
Toad Soldier 2: Calm down, you frogs, calm-- (grunting) Knock it off!
Frog 4: They're gonna eat us!
Mrs. Croaker: Not on my watch. Take that. And that!
Polly: Ooh! I wanna riot too!
Hop Pop: Polly, don't throw that. Throw this potato instead.
Polly: Hyah!
(grunts)
Wally: Let me out! Let me out!
(all gasp)
(Ivy empties her plate, then throws it at one of the soldiers, denting his helmet in the process.)
Toad Soldier 3: (groans) Ouchie!
Toad Soldier 2: All right, that does it! (pulls out his mace)
(Suddenly, the doors fly open, and a cloaked figure enters.)
Anne: Enough! Guards, leave us. I'll get these frogs to fall in line.
Toad Soldier 2: You lot have made a huge mistake.
Toad Soldier 3: Enjoy your time with Commander Sasha.
(gulps)
(laughs menacingly)
Anne: (pulls back her hood) Hey, guys.
(all gasp)
All: Anne!
Sprig: Anne!
(He jumps into Anne's arms.)
Sprig: Boy, are we glad to see you. We've got a situation. We're not guests. We're--
Anne: Prisoners, I know. And it's worse than that. They're planning to execute Hop Pop!
(all gasp)
Hop Pop: Say what?! But why?
Anne: Turns out Hop Pop's been inspiring rebellions all across the valley. Blah, blah, it's some political nonsense.
Hop Pop: Well, it's a good-looking poster, though. (beat) I'm gonna die!
Mrs. Croaker: Don't worry, youngster. We won't let 'em get you.
Felicia: So what do we do?
Anne: Nobody panic. I'm busting us out of here. Somehow. Anyone got any ideas?
Loggle: I do...n't. I don't.
All: Aw, come on!
Sprig: Geez, Loggle.
Wally: I've got one. What say we plant these boomshrooms around the joint? Blow the place sky high.
Anne: With us still inside? We're not doing that.
Wally: Right. We're not doing it.
Anne: Seriously. No boom shrooms.
Wally: Loud and clear.
Anne: Okay. Gotta figure a way out. Hmm. There's only one door, and the toads are outside it. There has to be some other wa-- (sniffs) (gasps) That's it! (grunts) The sewer.
Felicia: (sniffs) Oh, yuck, really?
Polly: Deal with it, lady. It's time to get dirty!
Felicia: Don't touch anything.
Mayor Toadstool: Oh, help me, Toadie.
Toadie: I got you, sir.
(rumbling)
(gasps)
(all scream)
(screeching)
Mrs. Croaker: Back, back, you filthy vermin!
(humming)
Wally: Just a little gift for our generous hosts. (laughs)
(beeping)
Anne: (gasps) Finally! I think we made it.
(Anne throws open a manhole cover.)
Anne: Ah! Fresh air.
(She suddenly finds herself surrounded by toad soldiers.)'
Sprig: Boy, those toads really stink!
(He then notices the situation they are in.)
Sprig: Did I say stink? I meant, are very handsome.
(Sasha, wearing her armor once again, walks between the toads.)
Sasha: (sighs) Anne, Anne, Anne. Very disappointing. Now let's move. Grime's waiting for us.
(snarls)
(scoffs)
(chuckles)
Sasha: Caught these prisoners trying to escape, Grime.
Anne: Dude, are you crazy?
Sasha: Shh. I'm trying to get us home.
Grime: Very impressive, Sasha. Always playing Flipwart when everyone else is playing Bog Jump.
Anne: Huh?
Sasha: Wha...
Grime: Well, see, Flipwart and Bog Jump are games, but Flipwart, of course, is far more complicated and... I'm trying to say you're smart!
Sasha: Oh. (laughs) Thanks, Grime-sy. What can I say? Just how I do. Up top.
Grime: Ah... Um... Yes.
(The Plantars all grumble.)
Anne: Sasha, please! There has to be another way! Oh!
Grime: There is no other way, creature. Our very way of life is at stake. I don't expect an outsider like you to understand. Seize the traitor, Hopediah Plantar.
Hop Pop: No! Get your hands off me!
Sprig: Hey!
Hop Pop: Kids!
Anne: No!
(grunting)
Toad Soldier 4: Hey, that's mine.
(grunting)
Anne: Stay back!
(grunting)
(groans)
Wally: Do your worst.
Felicia: Oh, if you're gonna bring it, then bring it.
Toad Soldier 5: In retrospect, we really should have tied them up.
Sasha: Enough!
(The toads part away, revealing Sasha. She strides over to Anne.)
Sasha: Anne, what are you doing? Are you really gonna risk your life for these talking frogs? We don't even belong here. Don't you wanna get back home? See your family?
Anne: (hesitantly) Yeah, but--
Sasha: Then put your sword down now. End of discussion.
(Anne's shocked expression changes to a nervous one. She looks around, then sadly lowers her guard.)
Sasha: (offscreen) There we go. That's my girl.
(Sprig looks upset at what's happening.)
Sasha: There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
(Suddenly, a sludgeball strikes Sasha in the face.)
Sasha: What the heck?!
(all gasping)
Sprig: For someone who's Anne's best friend, you sure don't know her very well. She's brave! She's smart! And most of all, she's not gonna be pushed around by a bully like you!
(Anne smiles, touched by Sprig's words. Sasha wipes the sludge off her face.)
Sasha: (grunts) I think I've had enough of you, squeaky toy. (grunts)
Sprig: (yells)
(sword clanks)
Sprig: (gasping)
Anne: (grunting)
Sasha: Anne, what are you doing!?!
Anne: (infuriated) Something I should have done a long time ago: Standing up TO YOU!
Sasha: (gasps)
Anne: Thanks for believing in me, Sprig.
Sprig: Spranne against the world.
Grime: (chuckles)
Sasha: What are you laughing at?
Grime: Looks like you've got a rebellious seed of your own. You've given me plenty of advice. Now let me give you some. Stamp this out. Make her yield. Fail, and nothing will ever be the same.
Sasha: Not gonna happen.
Grime: This should be fun. My friends! Instead of a messy free-for-all, I have a splendid idea. How about we settle this (jumps onto a rock) the toad-fashioned way? (snaps fingers)
(Toad guards surround Anne and Sasha.)
Grime: Trial by combat! If your champion wins, you all go home, no harm, no foul. But if our champion wins, well...
(Venus flytrap roars)
Grime: (laughs) Baby's hungry.
Hop Pop: Anne, you don't have to do this.
Anne: Yes, I do.
(Anne and Sasha circle each other, the atmosphere intense. Then they stop and face each other, glaring. All is silent, then...)'
Grime: Begin!
(grunting)
Sasha: What's gotten into you, Anne? You were never like this back home!
Anne: Do you ever stop talking?!
(grunts)
(gasping)
Anne: Haha! (Sasha knocks her sword away) Oh, come on, a dagger?
(both grunting)
Sasha: They're just slimy little frogs, Anne! They don't matter!
Anne: They're not just frogs. (picks up sword) THEY'RE MY
FRIENDS!!!
(She swings her sword forward, knocking both Sasha's sword and dagger out of her hands. Sasha falls backwards and lands on her butt. She now has a scar below her right eye. Anne points her sword at her.)
All: Whoo-hoo!
Polly: Go, Anne!
Hop Pop: Go, Anne!
Anne: It's over, Sash. You're not gonna push me around anymore.
(Sasha, defeated, glares at Anne.)
Anne: So how about it, big guy? We're free, right?
Grime:Yeah, I don't think so.
Anne: Whoa!
Sprig and Polly: Hop Pop!
(yelling)
Grime: Pretty cool, huh? This ends now.
(rumbling)
Grime: What the... What?!
Anne: Wally, what did you do?!
Wally: What? I thought we agreed. Wait, could you not tell I was winking? Ah, curse you, one eye!
(gasping)
(crowd screaming)
("Lean On Me" plays)
Toad Soldier 5: We gotta get out of here!
Grime: Hold ranks! Where are you going, you cowards?
Hop Pop: Ah! Eh, I never liked that guy.
Toad Soldier 6: Move, move, move!
(screams)
Hop Pop: Everyone! Come on, get off the roof, quick!
(man humming "Lean On Me")
(screaming)
Sasha: Whoa!
(whimpers)
Sasha: (gasps) Anne! (screams)
Anne: Sasha!
(screams)
Anne: Gotcha.
 Sometimes in our lives 
Anne: I've got you, Sash. You're gonna be okay-- (screams, grunts)
 We all have pain 
(screams)
(whimpering)
- We all have sorrow 
Hop Pop: I think that's everyone.
(Anne shouts)
Sprig: (gasps) Anne!
Anne: Can't... hold on... much longer.
- But if we are wise 
Sprig: Don't worry. I got you-- Oh!
Hop Pop: (grunting) Hold on, kiddo.
(screams)
(Anne grunts)
Anne: Hey, hey. Look at me, look at me.
 Lean on me 
Anne: Everything's gonna be totally fine. Just hang on.
 When you're not strong 
Hop Pop: We got you, Anne. No matter what.
(grunting)
 I'll be your friend 
Polly: Uh, guys? I think we have a situation.
 I'll help you carry on 
 For, it won't be long 
(straining)
Sasha: Hey, Anne?
 Till I'm gonna need 
Sasha: Maybe you're better off without me.
 Somebody to lean on 
Anne: No!
(music stops)
(wind whooshing)
Grime: Hyah!
(squeals)
(screaming)
Mrs. Croaker: Curse these old legs.
(grunting)
Wally: Hi, Mrs. Croaker.
Mrs. Croaker: Mayor Toadstool?
Mayor Toadstool: Uh-huh. If y'all die, who'll I embezzle money from? Huh?
Mrs. Croaker: Shut up and run!
(growls)
Sprig:Anne, are you... okay?
Anne: Oh, yeah. Never felt be-- (cries)
Polly: Aw.
Mrs. Croaker: Whoa, girl. Easy now. All right, everybody, we're home.
(all sigh)
(groaning)
Wally: Two parties in one night.
Toadie: Think you could carry me again, sir?
Mayor Toadstool: (groaning) Never again, Toadie. Never again.
Hop Pop: I know that was hard for you, Anne. Thank you, you know, for everything.
Anne: Hop Pop, you three are my family. I'd never let anyone hurt you.
Sprig: So, you guys wanna get breakfast and come up with some kind of plan to get Anne home?
Hop Pop: It's gonna be dangerous. Perilous even.
Polly: Understatement!
Anne: Well, whatever happens next, one thing's for sure. (brings the family in for a hug) If we're together, I know we'll be all right.
Hop Pop: Hugging a little tight there, Anne.
Anne: No, I'm not.
