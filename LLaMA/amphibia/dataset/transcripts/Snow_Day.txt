(It isn't long before Anne has collected everyone and places them all in the town square.)
Anne: Welp, that's everyone. Heh, that was surprisingly easy. (She proceeds to dab.) Town protector. Yea-yuh! And now all I have to do is watch 'em. (She sits down leaning on a frozen frog only for it to slide away. She yells and goes after it.)
(vocalizing)
Okay, I'm bored. And a bored protector is a bad protector. So I'm gonna need to thaw someone out. Let's see. Eeny, meeny, miney, Sprig.
Phew! This is harder than I thought. Thaw already, Sprig.
(sighs)
Whoa!
Where am I? What's goin' on?
Sprig! Boy, am I glad to see you, buddy. Uh... You okay, dude?
I's awake, yes?
Yeah. Let's thaw out the others. (groans)
Uh... I'm thinking we should let nature run its course. You frogs don't seem to do well in the cold.
Why you say that? Water angels.
Well...
Since you're already awake anyways, let's go have some fun. We've got the whole town to ourselves.
Let's do it!
Hey, Sprig. Catch.
Meh. Caught it.
-Eh. -Eh.
Oh, Mrs. Croaker, I never noticed how marry-able you are.
You too, Wally.
Come in for some kisses.
(kissing)
-(giggles) -(kissing)
(giggles) They're kissing.
Whoo-hoo!
(both laughing)
Look at it, Sprig. It's beautiful. No, no! Don't hurt Mommy.
-(groans) -(giggling)
(giggling)
Anne: All right, enough. We had our fun. But it's time for a little (dabs again) protector duty. (She pulls out a clipboard.) Let's do a head count, make sure everyone is still here.
Sprig: You got it. Am I still here?
We got Tom, Soggy Joe, Jill, Cashmere the Soft.
Hop Pop, check. Polly, check.
Ivy-- Polly?
Polly? No! No, no, no, no, no.
She's gone! What kind of protector am I?
Is something wrong with Polly?
Yes, Sprig. She's gone.
(sighs) This is all my fault. We've got to get her back.
All right!
Is something wrong with Polly?
Wow. Never tracked anything in snow before.
It's hard.
(grunting)
Hey! Who wants a nap?
(snoring)
(grunts)
Just hang on, Sprig. You can go back to hibernating
as soon as we find Polly.
Polly...
(sniffing)
I smell a Polly.
Polly's in that creepy cave.
Of course she is.
You know, no matter how long I'm in this world,
I'll never get used to the piles of bones just lying around.
Hey. That icicle looks just like Polly.
Ah! Polly!
How'd she get up there?
Is she magic?
(rumbling)
What was that?
Whoa!
-(roars) -(screams)
(screeches)
Maybe we can ask this lady. Excuse me, miss--
(grunting)
That's what's been taking the frogs?
I'll keep it busy. You go get Polly.
-(gasps) -Uh, okay.
(grunts)
Wait. Did you mean me?
Mm-hmm.
(snarls)
Polly! Stop dancing around so much. I'm trying to save you.
Hey! Sprig, look out!
Wow. Pointy.
Hey, you big furry freak! Get back here.
-(squeaking) -Huh?
What the...
(chittering)
(snarls)
-Huh? (yells) -(snarls)
No way.
(growling)
You didn't kidnap Polly just to feed yourself?
And if we take her, you'll all starve.
Unless...
Ah, perfect. Maybe just a little more.
-(growling) -Come on, come on. Please work.
(sniffing)
(purrs)
Huh. I guess the power of omelettes is universal.
(panting)
(screams)
(giggles)
(squeaking)
Now that's a protector.
Mm-hmm.
My face feels squishy.
Man, I really shouldn't have thawed you out.
Whoo-hoo!
(both) Five, four, three, two, one.
(Sprig) And thaw, baby, thaw!
-Huh? -Huh? Yee-haw!
-Oh, thank goodness. -We're all here.
We made it through the freeze.
Yay! I'm alive!
Three cheers for Anne, the best town protector there is.
(all) Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
Hold it.
(sighs)
I was a terrible town protector, you guys.
I slacked off when I should've been watching you.
I unfroze Sprig when I got bored.
I'm fine.
And worst of all, Polly almost got eaten by a giant weasel.
Say what?
I'm no town protector.
I'm just an irresponsible kid.
Anne, you admitting that means you're more responsible than you think.
Really?
Yeah, if you hadn't fessed up,
we never would have known anything happened.
-Oh, yeah, it's true. -That's a good point.
You may not be perfect, but you proved that we can depend on you.
And, most importantly, this is the first year no one disappeared.
All because of you.
Happy Hiber Day, everyone.
-Yay, Anne! -Whoo!
-Aw. Thanks, you guys. -Hey, everyone.
Check out these funny photos we took.
Sprig, no!
That's my body.
-(all gasping) -Oh, my...
Did you use our frozen bodies as bowling pins?
Uh...
