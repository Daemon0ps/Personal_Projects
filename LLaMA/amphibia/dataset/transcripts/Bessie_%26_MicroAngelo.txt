Polly: Good work, everyone! Wish I could help, but... no legs, you know?
Anbe: Mm-hmm.
Hop Pop: We depart for the final temple tomorrow, Bessie, ol' gal, and I have a big job for ya. Speak of the frog devil. Polly, leave Micro-Angelo here with us and get back to packin'.
Polly: Want me to grab a weapon or two from the hidden armory under the house?
Hop Pop: Go grab a weapon or three, dear. These temples have been pretty nasty, and I wanna be ready for anything.
Polly: That's what I'm talkin' about!
Hop Pop: Now then, Bessie, you remember Micro-Angelo? The cute little snail we bought in Newtopia? Well, I'm sure you've noticed that he is young and cute and needs to be protected at all costs.
Micro-Angelo: Meep.
By contrast, you are an older snail. Much older. I mean, you've seen your share of winters, that's for sure. The point is, while we're busy packing today, I'm gonna need you to take this little cutie under your shell, all right? He's your responsibility. Can I trust you with this very important job? That's my good girl. Don't let me down. 'Kay. Thanks. Bye.
Meep.
Meep.
Meep!
Ahh.
Can't have too many maps. Or can you?
Definitely gonna need these bad boys. And now to get more deadly weapons. Ha-ha!
Marcy: (clears her throat) So, Anne, I think we can both agree everything's riding on this last temple.
Anne: Yep.
Marcy: And can we also agree that you need some new gear already?
(She motions to Anne's sock, which is more worn out up close.)
Anne: Fair.
Marcy: Ah, good. Because I already fly-mailed Newtopia's best armorer, and he's on his way right now to give you a whole new look!
Anne: Hold up. Did she just say "new look"?
Sprig: Yep. What's the problem?
Anne: Oh, no. Not again. I cannot tell you how many times Sasha and Marcy have tried to give me a makeover!
(Three flashbacks on Earth show Anne sporting bad haircuts. The last one shows her screaming because she's bald.)
Marcy: (holding a razor) Too short?
(Back to the present.)
Anne: This is not gonna go well.
Meep, meep.
Meep.
Meep, meep.
My name is Bernardo.
Who is in need of my services?
Never mind. It is clearly you.
Is it really that bad?
It's worse.
I don't know, Mar-Mar.
These old duds have been good to me, you know?
Anne, we're probably going home soon.
Don't you want to live the fantasy a little? Try a new identity?
Role-play? Enough chitty-chatty.
Anne, who do you want to be?
Uh...
A melee-focused warrior?
Maybe a staff-wielding mage.
Well, I'm excited to see what you pick. Have fun, you two.
I'm gonna go mix a bunch of potions for tomorrow.
But... In Newtopia this season, it is all about barbarian.
Furs. Metal studs. Mallets. Everyone looks good in barbarian.
Trust me.
Barbarian sounds pretty cool.
Why don't you just wear a few and see how you feel? It won't hurt to try.
First up, this lovely little number covered with painful poison barbs.
Never mind. That looks like it'll hurt. Sprig!
Meep! Meep!
My potion!
Meep, meep.
Hmm. Aah!
Ow. Holy hornets! My maps!
Bessie, what's gotten into you?
You're supposed to be looking after Micro-Angelo,
not causing a frog-dang ruckus!
What the heck happened?
I thought you were my good girl.
This was obviously just too much responsibility for ya.
Come on, Bessie.
Oh?
Sorry, old girl.
Today's preparations are just too important.
Meep? Meep, meep.
Meep?
Uh, guys?
Not really sure this is my style.
I think you look neat. Loving that loincloth.
Hmm, it is a bit loud. Let's try a few options.
- Eggwellems! - Aah!
Perhaps a sorceress supreme?
Eh, too magical.
An elite commando?
Too formal.
Crane style! Mantis style!
Moth style. No more bugs!
Your friend is, um, how to say?
Hard to please. Tell me about it.
Guys, this stuff is cool and all, but it's too much.
I mean, who even needs these giant metal hands?
Technically speaking, those are siege gauntlets with built-in fire launchers.
Is that a tiny trebuchet?
I'm gonna touch it. No, Sprig, no!
Oops. Sprig!
Meep! Meep!
Aah!
What in the world?
Oh! What's happening?
Wow.
Somebody please narrate what's happening.
What?
Oh, my frog, Bessie!
Not only did you save Micro-Angelo,
you saved us from being nearly obliterated.
- Who put these boom shrooms here? - Uh, guilty.
Help. Please.
Are you okay? Anne!
Anne: This feels... perfect! (raises her fists)
Marcy: (holding Anne's cheeks) Are you ok? Did you hit your head? Are you crazy now?
Anne: Listen, I think the reason I don't want a new look because I'm finally happy with who I see in the mirror right now. So no matter what I put on, I just wanna see the same person smiling back. So what do you guys think?
Bernardo: Minimalist. Bernardo like.
Marcy: You're right. It is perfect.
Sprig: Whoo!
Marcy: But a summer cut might be cute. (She moves her fingers like scissors. Anne gets annoyed and slaps her hand away.)
Hop Pop: Looks like I owe you an apology. I knew you were my good girl. And you know? Maybe it was all too much to put on your shoulders. Tell you what. After today, you'll never have to look after Micro-Angelo again. How's that... sound?
Okay. Whatever you guys want.
I mean, you'd know better.
