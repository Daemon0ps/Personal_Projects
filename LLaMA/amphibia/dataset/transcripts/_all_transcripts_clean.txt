(Anne uses said weapon: surprised and jealous, Polly tosses her hatchet on the ground and pouts.)
(Everyone skids to a halt: Marcy's cape really is on fire again somehow.)
(Marcy's look softens into a gentle smile: she grabs Anne's hands.)
(PA: man) All right, students, doors locking in three, two, one.
(Sprig): Don't kill me! Please!
(Title: END OF PART 1)
(humming) Hop Pop: Mmm! (slurping)
- (slams) Anne: Yo, Toadstool! Hop Pop sent me to ask about these parking tickets. (Grunts as she lugs in a chest filled to the brim with tickets.) He says he wasn't even in town on these days.
- Anne: (groans, gasps) "Did y'all see that? We just got cut."
- Polly: Not like it makes a difference at this point.
- Sprig: "Eh, what are ya gonna do?"
-Anne, Polly, and Sprig: An arcade?
-Anne: "Are you kidding? We have to say something."
-Anne: Man, this is a long line.
-Anne: Totally worth it.
-Hop Pop: All right, kids. We're here.
-Polly: "Yeah, Anne. He's beneath us."
-Polly: Kill me.
-Polly: You're the best Hop Pop who ever hopped.
-Sprig: "I don't know, Anne. Isn't it just better to let this one go?"
-Sprig: Maybe it'll go quickly.
Alastair frog: So I named my kid Alastair last night.
Alastair frog: Take that, you stinking Hunterite.
Alastair frog: Wow, you're a good dad.
Alastair: May I sing you the traditional song of my people?
Alastair: We must go after her!
Albus Duckweed: Ahem! Welcome to the official mayoral trials, where the candidates try to win your vote.
Albus Duckweed: Excuse me, everybody, but I hear we have a couple of love doves here tonight. Ivy Sundew and Sprig Plantar. Whoo! A big hand for them. Come on, let me hear it. Hopadiah Plantar says, "Sprig, don't mess this up for us." And Felicia Sundew would like Ivy to "have a great courtship. Wink." It says "wink" here. "Love, Mom." All right, then. Hit it, boys!
Albus Duckweed: Excuse me, hello. Over here. Yoo hoo!
Aldo, Bufo, Beatrix: Huh?
Aldo: Barrel's Warhammer.
Aldo: It is said that the one who wields this hammer is the true leader of all toads. It is the one thing, the only thing, that will prove we should follow you.
Aldo: We hereby grant you the support of all three towers for your rebellion.
All (except Hop Pop): Whoo!
All Girls Singing: Riding snails, But it's no big deal. (Marcy) Eating flies. (All Girls) But it's no big deal. (Anne) Finally me, and it's no big deal.
All Three Girls Singing: Ohhhhhh It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! I feel at home in a place that shouldn't be real! (Anne) Killer birds, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Sasha) Riding snails, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Marcy) Eating flies, (All Girls) but it's no big deal! (Anne) Finally me, and it's no big deal!
All: (booing)
All: (chanting) Cut, cut!
All: (chanting) Cut, cut, cut!
All: (chanting) Hail Alastair!
All: (chanting) Hail Hunter!
All: (chanting) Hop Pop! Hop Pop!

All: Whoo-hoo!
All: Woah!
All: Wow!
All: Wow.
All: Yay! (screaming)
All: Yeah!
Anbe: Mm-hmm.
Andrias: (laughs) Why, it's a message from Marcy. Looks like they're making progress. That's enough for now, Yunan. I'll handle the rest.
Andrias: How disappointing.
Andromeda: *grunts*
Anne & Hop Pop: (arguing)
Anne & Hop Pop: I'll do it!
Anne & Hop Pop: We're working on it!
Anne & Polly: (gasp)
Anne & Wally: We did it!
Anne (closing her eyes and still doing the pose): This is all about harmony, people. Can you feel it? (opens her eyes as she does a different pose) Can you feel the harmony?
Anne (emotional, looks at Sasha): I'm s-s-sorry Sash. I thought can help. But-but-
Anne (face covered): Is it safe to look yet?
Anne (flashback): Kill me.
Anne (in awe along with Sasha and Marcy): WOAH!
Anne (in pain): this....
Anne (nervous): Hello, everybody.
Anne (offscreen): Beatrix that's not helping.
Anne (offscreen): Hop Pop, we live here.
Anne (offscreen): Next up, the three-legged race.
Anne (offscreen): Only award I've ever gotten.
Anne (to Sprig): Psst. Hit him with the "bad cop."
Anne and Polly: Ah.
Anne and Polly: Help! Get us out of here! Help! Get us out of here! Help! Help! (panting)
Anne and Polly: Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai!
Anne and Polly: Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai! Muay Thai!
Anne and Polly: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
Anne and Polly: We promise!
Anne and Sprig(reappearing suddenly): Go, go, go, go!
Anne and Sprig: (blaming) You came down here to fix the leak! Yeah, well, so did you!
Anne and Sprig: (both) Polly!
Anne and Sprig: (gasp)
Anne and Sprig: (pose with Sprig standing off Anne's hip) Spranne against the world!
Anne and Sprig: (screams)
Anne and Sprig: (sigh) Not really.
Anne and Sprig: (yell, grunt repeatedly)
Anne and Sprig: Let's do this thing.
Anne and Sprig: Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Anne and Sprig: Polly!
Anne and Sprig: Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Anne and Sprig: Spranne against the world!
Anne and Sprig: Whoa.
Anne and the Plantars: (grumbles)
Anne and the Plantars: Oh, no! Who could have predicted this?
Anne reading: "If you still haven't escaped, give Bessie some berries from the secret compartment in the front of her shell."
Anne(cleaning): Pow! Ha-cha! Ha!
Anne(coming in with Polly): Sprig! Psst! You gotta get outta here, man.
Anne(covering Sprig's mouth): Hey. We're just a couple of curious kiddos knocking on doors and saying hello.
Anne(eyes watering): This is amazing. So... relaxing. Is that my foot?
Anne(looking at Gunther's house a few minutes later): Yeah. Sprig, I don't think we should--Sprig!
Anne(looking at a book diagram of a carnivorous plant): Ew.
Anne(looking at two barrels with baking soda and vinegar): Finally. A chance to use everything I know about chemistry.
Anne(reading the name): Gunther? Who's that?
Anne(reading): "Mycroft Newtback, archives founder. This structure, originally Newtback's home, was turned into the public archives after he died violently attempting to travel beyond the valley."
Anne(reading): Be at the assembly at noon sharp.
Anne(to Mrs. Croaker): You walked right into that one.
Anne(to Polly): So, you wanna stay here and look at more pictures of hot Croaker?
Anne(trying to grab the stuff from him): Come on, Sprig!
Anne, Marcy Singing: (Anne) Took a leap through a box, super weird, to a swamp where frogs talk (Marcy) Oh,oh (Anne) Now I'm stuck, got no plans, just my luck, I'll do the best that I can (Marcy) Whoa, oh (Anne) Making friends and enemies, it's weird, but hey, it's grown on me! (Anne and Marcy) Bugs frogs, newts, and toads, gonna be a bumpy road. Flies for snacks, worms for lunch, I think I actually love this swamp! It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! Find a way to start again, brush off the dirt and make some friends! It's no big deal! Yeah, no big deal! I feel at home in a place that shouldn't be real! Crazy strange, but it's no big deal!
Anne, Marcy, Grime and the Plantars: (gasps)
Anne, Marcy: And together, we're gonna find Sasha and find a way home! (grunting, laughing)
Anne, Plantars, and Marcy: (yells)
Anne, Polly: Hi, Mrs. Croaker!
Anne, Sprig & Polly: We got it.
Anne, Sprig, & Polly: Whoa!
Anne, Sprig, Polly: (gasp)
Anne, Sprig, and Hop Pop: (gasp) Not the baby!
Anne/Hop Pop/Polly: Sprig!
Anne/Hop Pop: Gimme that!
Anne/Hop Pop: Huh?
Anne/Hop Pop: Perfect.
Anne/Hop Pop: The corn thief!
Anne/Hop Pop: Whoa.
Anne/Polly/Sprig: Stay inside, hide your eyes, give us practical supplies!
Anne/Sprig: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Anne:  No, you'll never make me go! 
Anne:  We'll get Swamp Slushies while we're out. 
Anne: "Calamity Box"? Eesh. That does sound bad.
Anne: "Suspicion Island". It's, like, my favorite show. I've got the new season and didn't even know it. It must have auto-downloaded before I got here.
Anne: 'Sup, HP?
Anne: 'Sup, Polly?
Anne: (As she opens the main doors) Hey, Hop Pop, what's the ETA on things down here? Not that I'm in a hurry to move back in or whatever. (Hop Pop glares at her.) What? I'm just curious. A girl can't ask about her flooded makeshift bedroom without getting grilled? Sheesh.
Anne: (Facing upsidedown, groaning) Go away.
Anne: (Getting out the room first) Why, thank you, also best roomie.
Anne: (Hops out of pipe and starts cutting down flagpole)
Anne: (Observes from the alley.) Who's that?
Anne: (Rolls down hill in her sleeping bag) Whoa! No, no, no! No, no, no! (screams)
Anne: (Scratches her back and finds huge spider)
Anne: (Trips on a rock and yells)
Anne: (Waiting) Come on. Come on!
Anne: (activates her powers) ENOUGH!!! (jumps up while Sasha looks at her in awe)
Anne: (asleep) Five more minutes.
Anne: (blushes) I know it's not the coolest, but this is important to them.
Anne: (chuckles)
Anne: (chuckles) Aw. Thanks, buddy.
Anne: (chuckles) Hey, guess who found the puzzle? Whoa! Whoa!
Anne: (chuckles) It's not all that. I miss my home and my stuff and especially... my friends. Without them, I just feel kind of lost. You know?
Anne: (chuckles) Oh, don't be silly. I insist.
Anne: (chuckles) She's persuasive, right?
Anne: (chuckles) The what now?
Anne: (chuckles) They're fun.
Anne: (chuckles) Yeah. Maybe it's time we started making our own decisions, huh?
Anne: (clears throat) Well, I'm gonna walk away before things get more awkward.
Anne: (clears throat, offscreen) (onscreen) Who has two thumbs and is a neutral arbitrator who fell out of the sky? This girl! (points at herself)
Anne: (confused) "We"?
Anne: (coughing) Watch where you're pointing that thing.
Anne: (coughs)
Anne: (coughs) What?! Hop Pop's not a revolutionary!
Anne: (dramatically) That Anne is dead and buried. (normally) Now come on, these plans ain't gonna study themselves.
Anne: (excitedly) Pillow fight!
Anne: (exhales) Uh, you mean like with numbers and stuff?
Anne: (falls) *grunts*
Anne: (gasping) Whoa, buddy. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Maybe we can go into the woods and find a new grubhog?
Anne: (gasps)
Anne: (gasps) Aw!
Anne: (gasps) Finally! I think we made it.
Anne: (gasps) How did you know?
Anne: (gasps) I better take care of these moneymakers if I wanna keep this up. (grabs a stick of butter and rubs it on her face) Babies. Babies are hungry.
Anne: (gasps) I have something even better. Everyone, take cover! Peony Princess bath bomb! Good-bye, dear friend.
Anne: (gasps) I thought it was a stray animal or something.
Anne: (gasps) It's...
Anne: (gasps) NO WAY.
Anne: (gasps) Oh, no. Hop Pop! Hop Pop!
Anne: (gasps) Oh, oh! Trust no one!
Anne: (gasps) Something's in trouble.
Anne: (gasps) That's it! Hey, mustache! Is that trophy made out of gold?
Anne: (gasps) That's it! Light timer. Timer, sunlight, light, skylight! I bet we can get out through the skylight!
Anne: (gasps) Well, excuse me for trying to make you less of a disgusting little slob! (gasps)
Anne: (gasps) What's flipwart?
Anne: (gasps) What? She ditched me? But this is all for her. (groans) I got to find her and get this thing back on track. See you, Tuti.
Anne: (giggles) Classic old Hop Pop bein' a freak. I'm gonna give that nerd a little scare.
Anne: (giggling) I like your moxie, frog child. Let's do it!
Anne: (grabbing Sprig) Sorry, sorry! Bill the king! Bill the king.
Anne: (groaning) (exhales) (groaning)
Anne: (groaning) So... heavy.
Anne: (groans)
Anne: (groans) A foodie. Say no more. We dealt with snobs like him all the time back home. Just listening to him is driving me crazy. (groans) I can't take this anymore.
Anne: (groans) But I've waited so long. And getting out of this valley might help me find answers on how to get home.
Anne: (groans) Enough! If none of you are going to admit to it, the least you could do is help me fix my phone.
Anne: (groans) Five more minutes.
Anne: (groans) Haven't we waited long enough? We've gotta get down there.
Anne: (groans) I can't believe this. I tried to do things the right way! And now I'm gonna die stuck in this stupid hole and I'll never get back home!
Anne: (groans) I can't believe this. I'm so stupid.
Anne: (groans) No, no, no, no! I told you guys. This party has to be lit. At this rate, it's gonna be lame. Hop Pop, lemme see those jokes. (Hop Pop hands her the jokes) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know what? Written jokes are passe. Why don't you get up there and do some improv?
Anne: (groans) So boring.
Anne: (groans) Sprig!
Anne: (groans) Well, did we make it? Did we save the stand?
Anne: (groans) Who's that jerk? And why won't he shut up?
Anne: (groans) You guys okay?
Anne: (groans, grunts, sighs)
Anne: (grumbles)
Anne: (grunting)
Anne: (grunting) Hold up. We're here. Now, that is an ugly tree.
Anne: (grunting) Sprig! Grab on!
Anne: (grunts and shrieks)
Anne: (grunts)
Anne: (grunts) Can you believe I was living in your basement? Ha! It was cold, dusty, not to mention smelly. Oh, no offense.
Anne: (grunts) Charge!
Anne: (grunts) Fine! I'll do it for Sprivy. No way I'm letting that ship sink.
Anne: (grunts) Five more minutes.
Anne: (grunts) I don't believe this. He double-crossed us. The first teacher I really clicked with ended up being a fake. Well, he's not getting away with this. Polly, got any more boom shrooms?
Anne: (grunts) I'm down! Anne's down!
Anne: (grunts) Marcy, what are you doing?
Anne: (grunts) Pull yourself together, man. We can do this. It's time to bring out the big guns. My parents' squid and basil special. No critic in town could resist.
Anne: (grunts) Rainbow magic!
Anne: (grunts, grabs the small creature) Gotcha! (the stingers hit the ground around her) Oop, gotta go.
Anne: (grunts, sighs)
Anne: (grunts, spits) Guys, it says here that our relationships define us, and nothing else. Nothing else!
Anne: (grunts, straining)
Anne: (hesitantly) Yeah, but--
Anne: (holds a makeshift scythe like a bat) Hey, batter, batter, batter.
Anne: (hugs her legs) Right.
Anne: (infuriated) Something I should have done a long time ago: Standing up TO YOU!
Anne: (inhales) This good?
Anne: (laughing)
Anne: (laughs)
Anne: (laughs) Oh, come on!
Anne: (laughs) Oh. That is where you're wrong.
Anne: (laughs) Sorry. Just... still can't believe you're here. (She starts playfully patting Marcy's head like a drum.)
Anne: (laughs) Sorry. Sorry. It's just that Hop Pop delivered the perfect sitcom catchphrase.
Anne: (laughs) Whoo!
Anne: (laughs) You got it.
Anne: (laughs) You should have seen the look on your face. You were dying!
Anne: (looking back) Ah, whiffed it. (gasps) Sprig!
Anne: (meowing)
Anne: (nervously) Hey.
Anne: (offscreen) Next up is the human knot... (onscreen) or in this case the human-frog-toad-newt knot thing. (Duckweed and Sasha roll their eyes) Try to untangle yourselves while holding hands.
Anne: (offscreen) Stop hitting the door with a battering ram!
Anne: (offscreen) Where I'm from, we didn't rush people in the bathroom! (Another thud is heard)
Anne: (onscreen) Okay folks, listen up! (offscreen) In order to defeat King Andrias and his robot hordes, we need to work together. (onscreen) First step, is the mirror exercise. I learned this one at summer camp. Everyone gather around in a circle and (does the mirror pose) mimic my movements exactly. (Sasha mimics it)
Anne: (panting)
Anne: (panting) Good, 'cause it's hot in here.
Anne: (panting) No Hop Pop yet. Oh, man. I hope he was able to get the flag--
Anne: (panting) Uh-oh.
Anne: (pulls back her hood) Hey, guys.
Anne: (reacts in disgust) Okay, okay, I'll help. Just never make that face again. First, we're gonna need some backup.
Anne: (reading) "When Bessie senses danger, you gotta sit on her shell and yell at the top of your lungs, 'Bessie, things are getting messy!'"
Anne: (saddened) Ah, poop.
Anne: (sarcastically) Must be nice.
Anne: (scoffs) I don't believe this. They're not a gang. They're just here to do a job. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some respect to enjoy.
Anne: (screaming)
Anne: (screams)
Anne: (screams) Get it off! (screams) No, no, no! Get it off! Get it off!
Anne: (screams) Hi. Who are you?
Anne: (screams) Uh... um...(laughs) What? No. I am loving this.
Anne: (screams) Whoa!
Anne: (screams, gasps) Guys, guys, guys. I just had the craziest dream. I was trapped in a world of frog pe-- (turns to find the Plantars looking at her) Oh.
Anne: (screams, grunts)
Anne: (sees the big rolling ball of newts, toads, and frogs) Oh no, not again!
Anne: (shouts)
Anne: (shouts) You're too fast.
Anne: (shudders)
Anne: (shudders) Eh, who am I kidding? I'll eat it. Harvest Day! I'm all in!
Anne: (shudders) Uh, me, me. I don't wanna steal this stuff.
Anne: (shushes)
Anne: (sighs)
Anne: (sighs) All right, fine.
Anne: (sighs) Everybody already treats me like a monster. This is just gonna make it ten times worse. (groans)
Anne: (sighs) Fine. What should we do till then?
Anne: (sighs) Guys, I have a confession. This extreme camping stuff is nonsense. I was miserable back there. I was just trying to cover it up.
Anne: (sighs) I'll never get that Skip Man now.
Anne: (sighs) My revolutionary ideas were supposed to save you guys, not get you killed. I shouldn't have so stubborn. I just really wanted to share a pizza with you guys.
Anne: (sighs) Oh, Domino 2, I thought I could change you.
Anne: (sighs) Okay, okay. Just don't forget about us. This place is gonna be dangerous, and we're here to help.
Anne: (sighs) Okay. I hope you know what you're doing.
Anne: (sighs) Polly, I'm the gross one. I tried to change someone that's perfect the way they are.
Anne: (sighs) So, off-roading. Fun. But how about we go back to on-roading?
Anne: (sighs) This is great. Two pals beatin' the odds to have some fun. Here. Smile! Whoa. Hey, that turned out great.
Anne: (sighs) This is ridiculous. I don't need history. (She puts the book in Bessie's bag and jumps onto her.) I need experience. Hey. What do you say we take a harmless test-drive? Prove to Hop Pop we're fast learners? (Sprig starts to take her hand, but stops.)
Anne: (sighs) This party stinks. Some selfless Frog of the Year I turned out to be.
Anne: (sighs) Well, it's just...I've been here over a month now, and the townspeople still treat me crummy. I just wish they were a little nicer.
Anne: (sighs) Well, just goes to show ya. You can't take some wild animal you found in the woods, have it live in your basement, and think everything's gonna be okay.
Anne: (sighs) You know, sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get home.
Anne: (sighs, then complains) How is it still so hot in here?
Anne: (singsongy) Hey.
Anne: (slaps the rein to the ground) Not happening, bud.
Anne: (slurping) Once... what's over?
Anne: (sniffs) I think that'd be good. I'd hug you except, you know, magical restraints.
Anne: (sniffs) Know what this smells like?
Anne: (sniffs) Ugh! What is that? Did something crawl under the house and die?
Anne: (sniffs) Ugh! What is this poison?
Anne: (sniffs, snorts)
Anne: (snorts) Okay... go. You got this.
Anne: (sobbing) Who knew coral came in such variety?
Anne: (squealing)
Anne: (squeals)
Anne: (squeals) You guys! You won't believe what I found in there. A Skip Man!
Anne: (stammers) You don't know me. I'll prove I deserve this by putting on a party so big, it'll blow all your minds! (echoes)
Anne: (starting to cry, yells) Because I just got you back, okay? (Marcy looks surprised.) And I don't... (sniffs) I don't wanna lose you again.
Anne: (sticks two straws up her nose)Look, guys! I'm a straw-lrus! Like a walrus, but with straws!
Anne: (straining)
Anne: (struggles) I'm seriously stuck! (struggles) Do something!
Anne: (taps rhythmically)
Anne: (to Polly) Oh, no, no, no. It's okay, Polly. You're just a baby. (to Hop Pop) But you! I cannot believe you forgot about something so important, Hop Pop!
Anne: (to Sprig): Sergeant, could I speak to you for a moment?
Anne: (whispers) Don't you dare talk about pineapple on my pizza. Ever. Okay. Let's go get those ingredients. Pizza dreams!
Anne: (whispers) Here, take this back.
Anne: (whispers) Here, take this.
Anne: (whistles)
Anne: (winces and holds her chest) Oof, even I felt that one.
Anne: (writing the word, spitballin', on the chalkboard) Alright friends, any ideas? Remember, this is a safe space full of chill vibes and good intentions.
Anne: (yawn) Never thought I'd be sleepin' in this cave again. Not since the Plantars took me in. Well, at least I'll always have you, Rocky. Sweet, sweet dependable Rocky. Yeah, I just can't take you seriously with that hair.
Anne: (yawns) Ahh.
Anne: (yells)
Anne: *clears throat* Great segue. To thank you Ribbitons for your hospitality, I have prepared a special presentation.
Anne: *groans* Kinda went off script there.
Anne: *grunts*
Anne: ...A friend?
Anne: ...tomato.
Anne: ...you're gonna tell Ivy how you feel about her!
Anne: A forest full of brains for the intelligence temple? Kinda on the nose, don't you think?
Anne: A little to the left. There, that's perfect.
Anne: A pinch.
Anne: AHHHHHHH!!!!!
Anne: Aaah!
Anne: Aah!
Anne: Absolutely not! Give me my backpack!
Anne: Absolutely.
Anne: After today, I'm pretty sure this gang can handle anything.
Anne: Agreed. Now let's get out of here before something else happens.
Anne: Ah!
Anne: Ah! Fresh air.
Anne: Ah, this is so boring. (groans) Wish I had something to read.
Anne: Ah, yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about! Cannonball!
Anne: Ah, yep. Yeeep. This all tracks.
Anne: Ah-- Huh?
Anne: Ahem. Actually I wrote a song about Amphibia and I was hoping we could play it.
Anne: All I wanted was this town's respect. But just because these people treated me crummy doesn't mean I'm going to do the same to them. I'm done with this. I don't care if they've broken the law. You can't treat people like this!
Anne: All good. See you in the a.m.
Anne: All night. Couldn't sleep, too excited! So, you ready to beat that critic?
Anne: All packed and ready to go. Ah! Too excited to sleep!
Anne: All right! Give me those reins. I'm ready to drive. (At the Plantar Farm, Hop Pop drops a big book on a tree stump.)
Anne: All right! One down, two to go! Ow!
Anne: All right, Anne. You can do this.
Anne: All right, Bessie. Let's move. (She whips Bessie, but she doesn't move.) One more time. Let's move. (Bessie still doesn't move.) Um, Bessie?
Anne: All right, Polly. Time to shine.
Anne: All right, all right.
Anne: All right, all right. Keep doing what you're doing.
Anne: All right, dude, put the stuff back. We're leaving.
Anne: All right, dude. What's going on? I know you don't wanna do this.
Anne: All right, enough. We had our fun. But it's time for a little (dabs again) protector duty. (She pulls out a clipboard.) Let's do a head count, make sure everyone is still here.
Anne: All right, guys. Fight mode!
Anne: All right, let's go home. (Bessie starts moving again. Back on Mrs. Croaker's ladybug, Sprig is lying down, fed up with the song she is singing.)
Anne: All right, same drill. Good cop, bad cop time.
Anne: All right. Well, that's the only mission today, so what do you guys wanna do?
Anne: All the best cops have mustaches. Now, here's how it's gonna go. I'm the good cop. So I'll butter 'em up and make 'em lower their guard. Then bam-o! You come in as the bad cop and get the confession.
Anne: All this time I thought I can solve your problems and heal this rift.
Anne: Almost. Nearly there. Got him! Oh, wait a second.
Anne: Almost... there. Woo hoo! I did it! Take that, Hop Pop. Who's brain is rotten now, sucker?
Anne: Alright, let's go crush this temple!
Anne: Also, I'm crazy out of shape.
Anne: Also, check out this cool sword Bog gave me.
Anne: And I told you I didn't want you to.
Anne: And Polly.
Anne: And here's where Sasha plays a killer guitar solo. We sing the refrain one more time, and then we're done.
Anne: And that is the masterpiece, From Pointe to Poppin.
Anne: And that's enough for tonight.
Anne: And the verdict?
Anne: And then we ran, we tried to use torches, it was all a big thing. It was very dramatic.
Anne: And this bad boy is my kitty Domino.
Anne: And you just couldn't wait to get rid of me! If you wanted me gone, you should have just said so-- Aah! (She is being dragged down by a river lamprey.)
Anne: And, let me guess, predicts the weather?
Anne: And, uh, I'm Anne Boonchuy!
Anne: And, wha-bam!
Anne: Anne. My name's Anne.
Anne: Any chance I can go back to being the monster that lives in your basement?
Anne: Any ideas?
Anne: Anytime, dude. Real talk though, I almost peed myself when they were gonna cut off my arm.
Anne: Are there pictures?
Anne: Are you kidding? I can't even go outside without making a scene.
Anne: Aren't these old detective films the greatest? It's like a normal movie, but no one talks out loud and everybody loses in the end.
Anne: As a matter of fact, I do. (pulls back her hood)
Anne: As long as we're back here before the ceremony, what's the difference?
Anne: At the party...
Anne: Aw, come on, Hop Pop- Wait, really?
Anne: Aw, thanks, Sprig.
Anne: Aw, thanks, guys. (sniffles) Now who wants to sign my cast?
Anne: Aw, yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about.
Anne: Aw. (sees a picture of a happy Wally and his beetle from years ago then sees the real deal looking miserable) Ugh. Well, if you're not gonna tell 'em, what are you gonna do?
Anne: Backhand! (She swings the racket onto the fly, making it fly away.)
Anne: Bathroom? Now? Can't you just hold it? (blows raspberry) (yells)
Anne: Beans, everyone. Wow, can you believe it?
Anne: Because you weren't just a jerk, you also inspired us. You're fierce, you're brave, and most of all, you never give up.
Anne: Believe it or not, we've got the same thing in my world.
Anne: Believe me, guys. Been there. They are making a sequel, Love Choice 2, but it's not out yet.
Anne: Bessie, get help! Get help! Come on, girl!
Anne: Bigger.
Anne: Blech! (coughing)
Anne: Blech. That's the corniest thing I've ever heard--
Anne: Blown away? Ha! No. All we've done is mop the floors and clean some dishes. This place is still a house of broken dreams.
Anne: Bog, I am telling you, he paid his taxes. He... He made me watch.
Anne: Boo!
Anne: Boom! Here are my plans for throwing the best party ever and proving that mayor wrong. Stupid mayor with his stupid dumb face.
Anne: Botched it?
Anne: Box.
Anne: Brace myself for what?
Anne: Break it down!
Anne: Brutal.
Anne: Bummer, dude.
Anne: But I do have a photo of it.
Anne: But I guess I was wrong.
Anne: But I guess we're sorry too. Looks like we pushed you pretty far. We'll try to be better about listening to you in the future.
Anne: But I was wrong. This is no quick fix. I can't solve this problem for you. (deactivates her powers and falls down softly while Sasha catches her) Only you can. So when you're ready to work together and save the world, let me know.
Anne: But th-this is the first time I've found something from my world! It could explain so much.
Anne: But the bad news is the only way to Wartwood is through the mountain pass, and Andrias has it locked down, guarded by a giant laser cannon.
Anne: But you hated Suspicion Island!
Anne: But--
Anne: Can we get out of this rain?
Anne: Can you fix it?
Anne: Can't... hold on... much longer.
Anne: Careful. The tree is cursed. Pfft! (laughs)
Anne: Carnie games? Fair food? Why can't it be like this all the time?
Anne: Cheer up, Sash. You're forgetting that I happen to be excellent at brokering peace between feuding factions.
Anne: Cheese!
Anne: Chemistry wins! Yes!
Anne: Click. (takes a picture with her phone; shows it to Loggle)
Anne: Come on, Mar Mar.
Anne: Come on, dude, you only know like one person!
Anne: Come on, guys! It's time to get...suspicious.
Anne: Come on, guys. Hop Pop's gonna need backup.
Anne: Come on, guys. We gotta hurry. Hop Pop could wake up at any second!
Anne: Come on, ladies. We can practice in my room.
Anne: Come on. Come on. (She sees two fishes above water. Anne jumps on the bed and hits them.) Backhand! (The lampreys hit the wall.) Had enough, river losers?
Anne: Come on. Mama needs a new pair of shoes. Seriously though, I do need new shoes.
Anne: Come on... Come on...
Anne: Comin'.
Anne: Cone on, come on. Yes!
Anne: Congratulations on your new son. Now cough up the dough.
Anne: Cool!
Anne: Cool, what else? "Armor." Armor?
Anne: Cool. Well, I guess we'll get going then.
Anne: Couldn't help it. This is just too juicy! Besides, when I'm done with you, you and Sylvia will be locking lips by the end of the night.
Anne: Crazy week, huh? Couple days ago, I was a monster. And now I'm the pride and joy of Wartwood. I've got a nice apartment, f-Annes, fame. But you know what I'm missing? The people who'll stick with me whether I'm a monster or not.
Anne: Cue emotional acceptance.
Anne: Curator! Yo! Curator!
Anne: Dang it.
Anne: Dang, HP. Looking good.
Anne: Dang, girl. This is where you've been hanging out this whole time?
Anne: Dang, she was hot.
Anne: Darn right I'm likable. I gave Jamie all my pudding cups at lunch. Even the chocolate ones with the vanilla ribbons. And nothing. What was her problem?
Anne: Deal. Let's do it.
Anne: Did you just say...the music box is gone?
Anne: Did you say we?
Anne: Did you...
Anne: Didn't you have friends before I showed up?
Anne: Do I? Here's me and Domino 2. She tried to eat us. Here's me and Sprig by the lake. There was a snake that tried to eat us. Oh, oh! Here's us running from a giant centipede that...
Anne: Do you ever stop talking?!
Anne: Do you hear that?
Anne: Do you really think she's changed?
Anne: Do you want this one?
Anne: Domino 2, is that you?
Anne: Domino 2? It's me, Anne. We bonded. I gave you treats. You gave me dead things. Don't you remember?
Anne: Don't ask questions!
Anne: Don't come any closer.
Anne: Don't follow me. Don't! I see you!
Anne: Don't look so glum, guys. It's just a ride. I'll be back in a few.
Anne: Don't make this harder than it is.
Anne: Don't mention it.
Anne: Don't worry about it, dude. It's okay if one person doesn't like you.
Anne: Don't worry. I'll find you guys later. Go have fun in there.
Anne: Don't worry. We can do this.
Anne: Done.
Anne: Duckweed...What's with the disguise?
Anne: Dude!
Anne: Dude, I've just spent the last hour talking with Wally about how miserable he is. Well, tonight I'm gonna help him come clean.
Anne: Dude, are you crazy?
Anne: Dude, come on!
Anne: Dude, have you lost your frog marbles? Put that piece back!
Anne: Dude, it's a tree. Just tell us where it is.
Anne: Dude, relax. I am not gonna eat something that clearly doesn't bathe.
Anne: Dude, spoilers!
Anne: Dude, there's no one here.
Anne: Dude, what are you doing?
Anne: Dude, what? That's completely crazy pants! Listen, Sprig, Mrs. Croaker is just like Jamie Krieger, who, for some inexplicable reason, didn't like me.
Anne: Dude, you just risked your life to recharge my phone. I think we're square.
Anne: Easy for you to say.
Anne: Eat our dust, hedgehogs.
Anne: Eat your aphids, don't play with them. Elbows off the table!
Anne: Eh, don't worry about it. I mean, the more I think about it, the whole idea of girl time is pretty weird. I mean, who's to say boys don't like spas?
Anne: Eh, potato, tomato. (grunts) Gangway, coming through. All right, dude. Get ready to be blown away.
Anne: Eh, we'll see.
Anne: Elaborate, huh? I like the sound of that! See you later.
Anne: Enough! Guards, leave us. I'll get these frogs to fall in line.
Anne: Er... There were maybe some swords, minor explosions. Anyways, I don't know where she is now. (sighs)
Anne: Especially, bad ones.
Anne: Everything! My pictures! My texts! Videos of my cat! Now all my memories from home are gone!! (She begins hyperventilating.)
Anne: Everything's gonna be totally fine. Just hang on.
Anne: Everything. Marathon dumb TV shows, drink boba till we vomited, hung out at the beach.
Anne: Ew.
Anne: Exactly. And we've only got one ingredient left. Tomatoes. According to this, they should be up ahead.
Anne: Excuse me, HP.
Anne: F-Annes. It's what we're calling my fans.
Anne: Fair point. Hop Pop, we're all in!
Anne: Fair.
Anne: Finally something we agree on. Hop Pop: We've got to take this thing down. Are you with me?
Anne: Finally, hundreds of hours of watching trash cop shows is gonna pay off.
Anne: Finally, we need candles for that evil ritual vibe.
Anne: Fine.
Anne: Fine. But just to pass the time. (coughs) Okay, let's see here. "It was an especially cold morning the day Bessie was brought into this world."
Anne: Follow my lead. (groans) Oh, man, Hop Pop, my stomach is killing me. Can we go back to the hotel?
Anne: Forget authenticity. Forget being a local. We should've used a brochure. A guide. Anything! Heck, we should've never left the tour bus. (screams)
Anne: Freedom!
Anne: Frog of the what?
Anne: Frogs don't sweat? Uh, jealous! Okay, next question. Sprig? (She spots Sprig sleeping.) Psst! Sprig? Sprig? Sprig? Sprig, Sprig, Sprig. Hey, Sprig! (She throws a pillow at him.) You awake?
Anne: Games don't rot your brain!
Anne: Get it!
Anne: Get out of here, man.
Anne: Get out!
Anne: Getting captured. I know. I get it. And I know they're just soldiers to you, but to me they're everything.
Anne: Getting these guys together will be a cinch. You'll see. We just need to find those connection points.
Anne: Gimme that ding-dang thing!
Anne: Glad I got to see them, though.
Anne: Glad to hear it. Lay it on me.
Anne: Glad to hear it. Now, let's try to save my skin.
Anne: Go get her.
Anne: Go on.
Anne: Gonna ignore that. Now, please enjoy this video of Wally's life in Wartwood. Edited by me. (plays a video on her cell phone)
Anne: Good morning, Hopadiah.
Anne: Good morning, my greasy babies. Time to get ready for the--(gasps) No. No. No, no, no, no, no. My pimples! What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? (gasps) Uh, hello? Anyone there?
Anne: Good night, Hop Pop.
Anne: Good to know.
Anne: Good, good. We're here about a shell that got misplaced. Recognize any of these?
Anne: Good.
Anne: Gotcha.
Anne: Great idea, Hop Pop.
Anne: Great! Mar Mar, what can I do to help?
Anne: Great! You're the best.
Anne: Great. But how can we get to the swamp without me being seen? I have f-Annes everywhere.
Anne: Grubhog!
Anne: Guess we won't be charging the stone today, huh?
Anne: Guess who became a Toad Tower deputy!
Anne: Guys!
Anne: Guys, cut it out. You're gonna--
Anne: Guys, get out of here! Save yourselves!
Anne: Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Look! (shows them her phone)
Anne: Guys, no!
Anne: Guys, now that we've been through a lot, there's something I'd like to share with you. This is how I got here.
Anne: Guys, remember this is about supporting each other.
Anne: Ha ha! Tricked you all! Now that you're face-to-face, how about discussing this like civilized--Whoa!
Anne: Ha! (dabs) Three-for-three, baby.
Anne: Ha! No way it's stronger than my Berry Blitz.
Anne: Haha! (Sasha knocks her sword away) Oh, come on, a dagger?
Anne: Have fun in there!
Anne: He won't!
Anne: He's after us.
Anne: He's too fast. We'll never make it.
Anne: Hello, everyone! For tonight, I've picked a conflict-free independent film called My Dinner with Anders. But before we start, a little context.
Anne: Hello? I brought the track team and band geeks together that one time to put on the school dance.
Anne: Help! Wait!
Anne: Here goes.
Anne: Here you go.
Anne: Here, go ahead.
Anne: Here. (She shows Sprig a trailer for a police show on her phone.)
Anne: Hey!
Anne: Hey! (panting)
Anne: Hey! Don't call me scarecrow. Oof!
Anne: Hey! Get your own Thai mom.
Anne: Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! You're all suspicious. Just look at you. Now, come on. Let's get going. The sooner we move, the sooner I get my memories back.
Anne: Hey! That was totally mine, Wally.
Anne: Hey! Watch it.
Anne: Hey! You can't tell them what to do!
Anne: Hey, Domino 2! Over here!
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop! Got the groceries!
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop, old buddy, old pal.
Anne: Hey, Hop Pop.
Anne: Hey, Mar Mar. How's your first day in Wartwood going?
Anne: Hey, Sasha!
Anne: Hey, Sprig.
Anne: Hey, Stumpy!
Anne: Hey, before I go, can we take a group photo?
Anne: Hey, buddy. Nice little place you got here. Business good?
Anne: Hey, careful with that basil, dude. We had to fight off like ten giant aphids to get it.
Anne: Hey, cut it out, you guys. Seriously. Ow!
Anne: Hey, guys. Wanna see something cool? Did you know that this thing has a laser? Wha-bam!
Anne: Hey, hey! Marbles. Big news?
Anne: Hey, hey. Look at me, look at me.
Anne: Hey, kid, need a lift?
Anne: Hey, let go of my bumpkin frog family!
Anne: Hey, look. There's a bed and breakfast just down the road.
Anne: Hey, sorry I almost got us killed today.
Anne: Hey, we've got a special dinner just for you. Be right back.
Anne: Hey, what took you so long?
Anne: Hey, what's going on here? Does it need fuel in the tank or something? Is the oil low? Come get the tasty fuel, Bessie.
Anne: Hey, where you guys been?
Anne: Hey, you're right. I never actually noticed that.
Anne: Hey. I didn't get a chance to ask your--
Anne: Hey. Lay off, buddy. Running a restaurant is hard.
Anne: Hmm.
Anne: Hmm. (Looks at her photo, then Sprig)
Anne: Hmm. Hey. What did that scroll say your one job was?
Anne: Hmm. It does kinda seem like she's obsessed with him.
Anne: Hmm. Maybe we can push her? Give her a jump-start? I'm sure that's a thing.
Anne: Hmm. Oh! Let's just link arms and lower someone down, just like the teens did in episode eight.
Anne: Hmm. Where is that--Aha! Score. And I got the last one.
Anne: Hmm. Yeah.
Anne: Hmm...
Anne: Hmm? Yeah, totally. Domino 2 just had a bit of a rough first night indoors.
Anne: Hmph. (She looks through at her photos with Sprig and chuckles at each of them.) Oh. Hey, Sprig, would you rather have a splinter you could never get out or get bit by a giant mosquito once a day forever?
Anne: Hold on! Guys, the shame cage isn't just in the town square. It's up here. You're not gonna change the world without taking a few risks. We need to be bold, groundbreaking, brave!
Anne: Hold still. (She removes the cape.) There! (Once it's on the ground, she stomps it out.)
Anne: Hold up, everyone. I have something that might work. It's called a "movie." It's like a play, but totally better.
Anne: Hold up. Did she just say "new look"?
Anne: Hold up. I got an idea. This worked on Domino 1 without fail.
Anne: Hold up. Stay behind me.
Anne: Holy cow, Wally. You're pretty good at this. You see this right here, Polly? This is what you should be doing.
Anne: Hoopa de boopa! Whoa!
Anne: Hop Pop!
Anne: Hop Pop! We found those Plantar family layers you were talking about.
Anne: Hop Pop, I forgive you.
Anne: Hop Pop, I... I...
Anne: Hop Pop, calm down. You are the king of this dance floor! You walk right up to that lovely lady and ask her to dance.
Anne: Hop Pop, if you wanna win over Sylvia...Never do freestyle again!
Anne: Hop Pop, it's just a vehicle. We had a family car back home. It's no biggie. (Hop Pop throws the book at her.) Oof!
Anne: Hop Pop, it's totally fine. It hurt, but I know you didn't mean to, and I want you to know that I'm really not mad about it.
Anne: Hop Pop, look out!
Anne: Hop Pop, no!
Anne: Hop Pop, shouldn't you be focusing on driving?
Anne: Hop Pop, this show's got beautiful people doing dumb things while stuff explodes! It's literally perfect.
Anne: Hop Pop, wha--What are you doing hiding in the bushes?
Anne: Hop Pop, what the heck, dude?
Anne: Hop Pop, you three are my family. I'd never let anyone hurt you.
Anne: How do I look?
Anne: How should I know-- (sees the drinks flying around) Oh. The drinks! Our body chemistry must be so different that we're having crazy reactions to each other's extreme beverage. That was the smartest-sounding thing I've ever said.
Anne: How was the convention, HP?
Anne: Huh.
Anne: Huh. Hmm. I know exactly what's going on here. Some jerk just wants this beautiful lake all to themselves. Well, forget that.
Anne: Huh. Never figured you for a hopeless romantic, Hop Pop. Let's do this thing.
Anne: Huh. Not at all. Wonder why.
Anne: Huh. So what do you think Hop Pop's making for dinner tonight?
Anne: Huh. Well, you know, we have a similar thing in my world called Halloween. We say "Trick or treat," and people give you free candy.
Anne: Huh. Yeah. Maybe Sprig's right, Hop Pop. Research is overrated.
Anne: Huh?
Anne: Huh? "Watched"? Who watched all these episodes and used up all the--
Anne: Huh? (She turns, and several scratches are shown on her cheek.)
Anne: Huh? Go Farmers? What's that all about?
Anne: I SAID ENOUGH!!! (uses the blue gem ability to push everyone away, everyone screaming in the process, to stop fighting)
Anne: I am not talking to you right now, Hop Pop. If that's even your real name. Oh, wait. Hop Pop's a nickname.
Anne: I can fix that.
Anne: I can't believe it's finally my turn to say this, but... told you so! Boom!
Anne: I did it. I read the whole thing. In one night.
Anne: I didn't ask you, Hop Pop.
Anne: I didn't even know you guys had a king.
Anne: I didn't make you drink my Berry Blitz.
Anne: I didn't want the baby carrots, Mom! I didn't want 'em! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! (A driver rolls up their window as she cries.) You know what?
Anne: I don't believe it. A real chance to get home.
Anne: I don't believe this. The town is split right down the middle.
Anne: I don't know!
Anne: I don't know, guys. This whole thing feels (grunts) wrong.
Anne: I figure if I'm gonna go missing in a different dimension, the least I could do is bring back a gift.
Anne: I get this place. It's like a library from my world. Zoobooks and manga, here I come!
Anne: I got a flamethrower!
Anne: I got it.
Anne: I guess I've been feeling kind of left out lately. I'm not a frog.
Anne: I guess even an outsider like me can be a Plantar.
Anne: I guess it's okay if I'm a little late... (chuckles)
Anne: I guess that's true, but, uh, I, uh, need to go to Wartwood to get the music box. Right, H.P.?
Anne: I have a bad feeling about this.
Anne: I have a distinct feeling that this temple is about strength.
Anne: I hear there's a Ferris wheel!
Anne: I honestly don't know what to do. Monroe's just a better dancer.
Anne: I just couldn't live with him! The wet towels, the heat, the humidity. The web crusties. (feels disgusted)
Anne: I just need time. Look, I want things to go back to the way they were. But--but-- (sobs)
Anne: I know things are bad, Hop Pop, but if it makes you feel any better, you were a crazy good salesman.
Anne: I know, I know. I shouldn't have gone off on my own. It was reckless. And besides, we work better as a team.
Anne: I know, I know. I'll show myself out.
Anne: I know, right? We've got to get them together. But how...Hey, Hop Pop. You ever play capture the flag?
Anne: I love it!
Anne: I love my cat more than anything in the world. She was irreplaceable. But now I found a replacement. Let's take her home with us!
Anne: I mean, to an extent, right? You kinda proved that when you buried the music box.
Anne: I said get lost. Now!
Anne: I say...let's crush this calamari. (gasps) I've got an idea.
Anne: I see what you did there.
Anne: I still think you should be honest with them. I mean, what do you have to lose?
Anne: I sure... can't!
Anne: I think I have an idea.
Anne: I think I lost an eyebrow.
Anne: I think I'm going to spend a little more time with ol' Bessie here.
Anne: I think it's your wet towels on the ground that'll get in your way.
Anne: I think the little one wants to kill me.
Anne: I thought I knew him, you know? But he was lying to me the whole time. Wish I had my bobby pins. (shouts) Oh. (scoffs) It's you. Go away.
Anne: I was gonna give this to my mom when I got home, but I think she'd want you to have it.
Anne: I was on varsity.
Anne: I was thinking we could hang out with these guys a little longer. They seem pretty cool.
Anne: I was wrong about Bessie. She's not just a vehicle. She's a noble, beautiful creature.
Anne: I was, uh, uh, feeling like a nighttime swim. What are you doing here?
Anne: I wonder what he learned about the music box.
Anne: I'll be your beast!
Anne: I'll defend you guys. Don't sweat it.
Anne: I'll go stay with someone who isn't a liar. I don't know, maybe Loggle? He seems like a straight shooter.
Anne: I'm Anne. What are you guys doing in Wartwood?
Anne: I'm a Drag-Anne-Fly!
Anne: I'm actually glad you suggested this, Hop Pop. I'm learning a ton about your terrifying world.
Anne: I'm always--Hey, not always.
Anne: I'm an only child, so I don't relate. All my parents' attention was focused on me. And it was... awesome.
Anne: I'm coming with you to Wartwood!
Anne: I'm fixing this right now.
Anne: I'm gonna go hit those books.
Anne: I'm here. I'm here.
Anne: I'm not a Plantar. Heck, I wasn't even invited on this trip. I really like you guys and wanted to be with you, miserable or not.
Anne: I'm not food! I'm not food! I'm not food! Get me the heck out of here!
Anne: I'm not used to such easy camping.
Anne: I'm really sorry, Hop Pop. I was goofing around, and I broke your favorite cane.
Anne: I'm so happy for you!
Anne: I'm sorry I couldn't make it work. (sighs) It's time to go. (grunts)
Anne: I'm suddenly very interested in politics. (Blows horn loudly.)
Anne: I'm way too invested right now.
Anne: I've got you, Sash. You're gonna be okay-- (screams, grunts)
Anne: I, uh, guess you owe the town money?
Anne: I-It's nothing. On your left.
Anne: I...guess that makes sense. Who's next on the list?
Anne: If they don't give it to you, you get to play a trick on them.
Anne: If we don't do something fast, this whole town is going to tear itself apart.
Anne: If we're gonna impress that critic, we've got a lot more work to do. We need a complete and total transformation.
Anne: If you think I'm gonna let my favorite froggy family end up in a cage, you've got another thing coming. I know I'm not technically a Plantar, but maybe I can help.
Anne: Impossible.
Anne: In my world, we'd call this a win-win.
Anne: Incoming!
Anne: Incoming! (She hits Sprig with a pillow.) Oh, sorry, dude.
Anne: Is that my shirt?
Anne: Isn't that right, Domino 2?
Anne: It can't be.
Anne: It feels like my lungs are going to explode.
Anne: It looks exactly like the water snake that almost ate me and Sprig.
Anne: It was a little different!
Anne: It's a form of traditional Thai martial arts. My mom enrolled me in a class when she realized how high-spirited I was.
Anne: It's actually pronounced "laap."
Anne: It's all worth it when you get to watch your adorable little boo take a nap.
Anne: It's fresh fish, okay? Get it. Burn these decorations and get new ones. Replace that jug band with a deejay. And where the heck is that chocolate fountain?!
Anne: It's from Marcy! She says we're ready to travel to the first temple.
Anne: It's gone.
Anne: It's just gotta pop out of the stump, right?
Anne: It's not a bun, Maggie. It's khao niew bing, a traditional Thai snack made up of rice and coconut milk. My mom made it for me because it's my birthday.
Anne: It's not even trying anymore.
Anne: It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
Anne: It's okay. We'd better head home. Hop Pop's probably already awake and furious.
Anne: It's over, Sash. You're not gonna push me around anymore.
Anne: It's settled. I hereby dub thee "Domino 2." Come on, girl. Let's go home.
Anne: It's some kind of crazy music box or something. Have you guys seen anything like it before?
Anne: It's totally okay. You're a baby! (grunts repeatedly) Almost got it! (struggles) Yes! (laughs, groans) Oh, yeah. No. Definitely can't fit through, though. Hey, I see Bessie. Bessie! Bessie, hey girl!
Anne: Just asking, Hop Pop. Ugh.
Anne: Just be honest with them. Tell them the truth and I know they'll support you. Just like my favorite movie From Pointe to Poppin.
Anne: Just fine? Pshh. Boy, I'm a natural. (gasps) Ooh, ooh! Wanna take this baby off-road?
Anne: Just go!
Anne: Just how long till it's fixed?
Anne: Just sit tight. Us humans will handle this.
Anne: Just watch.
Anne: Just... look at me. (shows her breakout)
Anne: Later, dude!
Anne: Layers, huh? Okay, then. Well, what's so special about her?
Anne: Lesson one. Footwork.
Anne: Lesson three. Freestyle. Freestyle is expressing yourself in your own unique way.
Anne: Lesson two. Rhythm.
Anne: Let's give him a minute.
Anne: Let's go!
Anne: Let's just find a way out.
Anne: Let's just say, me and them don't mix.
Anne: Like this, you guys! Like this!
Anne: Liking the sound of that!
Anne: Listen, Hop Pop, when push came to shove, you made a choice. It's fine. But let's stop pretending I'm part of the family, okay?
Anne: Listen, I think the reason I don't want a new look because I'm finally happy with who I see in the mirror right now. So no matter what I put on, I just wanna see the same person smiling back. So what do you guys think?
Anne: Little bit, yeah.
Anne: Live your truth! Yeah!
Anne: Look around you. Singing, butterflies, laughter. I guess I'm just used to something a little more... Extreme.
Anne: Look, I just wanted to help you be proud of who you are. A poppin' lockin' fresh don't stoppin' hip-hop B-girl!
Anne: Look, I'm glad you're being more cautious. But I think this whole thing has gotten a little extreme.
Anne: Look, dude, all I'm saying is that where I'm from you could get arrested for having a couch this firm.
Anne: Look, if a friend likes a pencil case, you get it for them. If your friend likes your new shoes, you give them to her. And if a friend wants you to steal a crazy music box from a thrift store, even if you don't really want to, you do it, okay? Because if you don't, they might not want to be your friend anymore.
Anne: Look, if we're gonna win this thing, we need something new, something revolutionary, something no one in the swamp has ever seen before. Something like...
Anne: Look. If you're gonna go down, you might as well go down fighting. Plus, I got you into this. At least let me try to get you out.
Anne: Look. That branch is perfect. (grunting)
Anne: Looks like Hop Pop's fishing for something else.
Anne: Looks like it's go time. (to Sasha) You ready?
Anne: Looks like we don't have a choice, HP.
Anne: Man, it's hot. (She puts her hood down.) Better.
Anne: Man, squid are huge here.
Anne: Man, that guy was hard to lose.
Anne: Man, these guys are really good actors.
Anne: Man, this thing weighs a ton!
Anne: Man, what is with this crowd? Are fruit flies on sale or something?
Anne: Mar-Mar, are you...sure?
Anne: Marcy!
Anne: Marcy! (screams) Let me down! Marcy! Help!
Anne: Marcy! Can you at least let us know what you're gonna move before you move it?
Anne: Marcy! No!
Anne: Marcy, any ideas?
Anne: Marcy, do you think we should stop? This could get dangerous.
Anne: Marcy? Marcy, I don't understand.
Anne: Maybe?
Anne: Me either, my froggy friend. But I'm not fishing. I'm parasailing, baby!
Anne: Me too. And you... defended me.
Anne: Mm! Uh! Melting. (She opens the window and the wind blows in.) Ah, better.
Anne: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think I found your problem, guys.
Anne: Mm-hmm. Your cape's on fire again.
Anne: Mmm, basement ghost?
Anne: Mmm.
Anne: Mother Olm?!
Anne: My battery is low. But it was fine last night when I turned it off.
Anne: My behind's not big. I'm big. Technically, it's to scale. Whoa!
Anne: My cat back home was a stray before I adopted her. All it takes is love and patience and... love.
Anne: My life is ruined. My zits. They're gone. Without them, I'm...I'm nothing.
Anne: My mom.
Anne: My mom? Um, kind... in her own way. But strict too. She wanted me to study more. Thought I goofed off too much. We didn't always see eye to eye. She annoyed me sometimes too. Like, in the kitchen, she'd always sing these goofy Thai love songs, and, man, was her singing bad. Woof! That woman was beyond tone-deaf. You know, the funny thing is, right now I would give anything just to hear her singing. Whoa! Sorry, sorry. I just, uh, need a moment. (sighs)
Anne: My room! My stuff!
Anne: NO!
Anne: NO! Now, hop to it, everyone. We've only got 12 hours left. Hop! Hop!
Anne: Need a refill of fly ice tea? On the house, sweetie.
Anne: Need a ride, old-timer?
Anne: Nerp. You know, it's funny. I've been hoping to find you for so long, but now that I actually found you, I have no idea what to do next.
Anne: Never mind. What can I do to fix this?
Anne: Newtopia. Of course.
Anne: Next, we have the trust fall. This is the final step to knowing that you'll have each other's backs out there. Now, when I say go...
Anne: Nice try.
Anne: Nice work, Hop Pop. Or maybe I should call you "Hip Pop?"
Anne: Nice! Just like group projects back home.
Anne: Nice! Using Toadie's stone body as a shield.
Anne: Nice. Totally innocent for once. You two should be ashamed.
Anne: Nifty. So, what kind of challenges we talkin'?
Anne: No can do. Marcy said she wanted to spend the day studying Frobo. Wonder how that's going.
Anne: No old recipes! Huh? (panting) (gasps) Hey, Brutus! Over here! !Toro! !Toro!
Anne: No way! Awesome!
Anne: No way! Dude, you're the best! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh. And the Curator said he got this from Newtopia. Which means we're on the right track.
Anne: No way. This might be the creepiest thing I've ever seen.
Anne: No!
Anne: No! (gags) Bad frog.
Anne: No! Chop you!
Anne: No! I'll do it. You just... stay here.
Anne: No! Look, I know it seems like I'm miserable, okay? But I'm not. It's just...It's just, uh...
Anne: No! No, don't look at me.
Anne: No! No. No, Bessie. Get-- No! Oh, come on. Never mind. Good news, guys. I can see the road from here. One of you can go for help!
Anne: No! That old book is old. Sprig's eternal happiness is a small price to pay for pizza.
Anne: No! Was it you?
Anne: No, Hop Pop. I'll step on the tile. This is my quest. It's my responsibility. Your responsibility is keeping your family safe, not me.
Anne: No, I'm not.
Anne: No, Sasha! it'll be more fun if you're here with us.
Anne: No, Sprig. Listen. This trip out of the valley, it's more than just another adventure. It's my chance to get home. I can't mess this up. So if that means doing a few things I don't like to help me get ready, well, then...
Anne: No, but I'll figure it out.
Anne: No, but you do have to be a master stacker to get to level 46. If I can just...(groans) Curse you, sudden death round! Why you so hard?
Anne: No, it doesn't! I can handle it.
Anne: No, it isn't! I need the music box to get home, and you buried it under a tree! What're you trying to do, keep me here forever? (gasps) That's it, isn't it? You sicko.
Anne: No, look! We can pick him up when we come back around. Ha-ha!
Anne: No, no! This needs work too. (gasps) Polly? That's not what those are for.
Anne: No, no! Why don't you stay on the tour? We can head back ourselves.
Anne: No, no, no, no, no!
Anne: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!
Anne: No, no, no.
Anne: No, thanks. I'd rather go to the lake.
Anne: No, this is good. I'll just play badly and sabotage the other team. Didn't think of that, did ya, temple? Ha! Here we go. Sabotage! (groans) Okay, I can't move.
Anne: No, you weren't. I have to protect you. Like I always do. Just like back home.
Anne: No. This caterpillar looks exactly like my cat Domino from back home.
Anne: No. Wait guys, we can talk about-
Anne: No. Wait, Sasha. I really think we should-
Anne: Nobody panic. I'm busting us out of here. Somehow. Anyone got any ideas?
Anne: Noooo!
Anne: Noooooooo!
Anne: Nope.
Anne: Nope. Here, see if you can find a way to survive a tiger viper attack.
Anne: Nope. I'm here to tell you this dumb feud with Polly is dumb. And you need to end it. Just let her have this one, dude.
Anne: Nope. Lying will only make it worse. I feel like we've learned that lesson by now.
Anne: Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
Anne: Not bad, Polly. But you still lack...
Anne: Not that you needed it. You're right. You really have changed.
Anne: Not the eyes, not the eyes!
Anne: Nothing's coming to mind!
Anne: Nothing. Anyway, I think we should focus our energy on more mature activities. Sprig! Use your kitty cat blasters!
Anne: Nothing. Let's get outta here.
Anne: Now all we gotta do is-- (clears throat) All we gotta do is get four ingredients-- dough, cheese, basil, and tomatoes. Are you guys ready to make our pizza dreams a pizza reality?
Anne: Now head out there and get back in the game.
Anne: Now that's king-sized.
Anne: Now this.
Anne: Now where were we?
Anne: Now, let's get this cane back to Hop Pop.
Anne: Nup, nup, nup.
Anne: O...kay.
Anne: Obvi.
Anne: Oddities museum? What the heck is an oddity in Amphibia? Am I right?
Anne: Of course, my situation is way worse than yours.
Anne: Oh yeah, just one more thing. "The Music Box!"
Anne: Oh!
Anne: Oh! Actually, I did find Sasha. We, uh... we had a fight.
Anne: Oh! He's so cute. Like a little sock puppet!
Anne: Oh! She's gonna bite their heads off as soon as she's done toying with them.
Anne: Oh! Uh, actually, I do have the box.
Anne: Oh! You guys gotta help me. He's gonna kick me out the second he finds out about this. I cannot go back to living in a cave!
Anne: Oh, by the way, Hop Pop. We found this on the floor. You must have dropped it.
Anne: Oh, cicadas, like little cute cicadas? Or like-- Oh, my God! That's huge! (yells) No!
Anne: Oh, come on!
Anne: Oh, come on, man. I can't afford that.
Anne: Oh, come on. This isn't cool, Sprig. This isn't cool!
Anne: Oh, come on. You're always being super tough on me for no reason. Just like my teachers back home. Blech.
Anne: Oh, cool! This place is filled with games and puzzles. Let's see if we can find which Plantar this stuff belonged to. No way. Emma the Newt? Honorary Plantar? Hey, check this out. She travelled all over the place, collected all this cool stuff, and settled with the Plantars. She wasn't even a frog!
Anne: Oh, cool. A doll collection.
Anne: Oh, crud.
Anne: Oh, crud. Bog, that list has to be wrong. I know that frog. He's totally honest.
Anne: Oh, good one. I think I'd... (The living room floods.) Didn't anyone fix the leak?!
Anne: Oh, he jelly.
Anne: Oh, hey, a dance floor!
Anne: Oh, hey. No biggie. I'm sorry for not trusting you earlier. Sasha, do you think maybe we could start over? Do things right this time?
Anne: Oh, how cute. It's shaped like a real-- Ah! Real bug. It's a real bug. Got it. So we just put the bug in the goal, right?
Anne: Oh, interesting.
Anne: Oh, it's on!
Anne: Oh, looks like I'm not in the game. Well, you guys have fun, I guess. (screams)
Anne: Oh, looks pretty cute.
Anne: Oh, man, this is all my fault. Everyone, grab a torch!
Anne: Oh, man. The font on these menus is way too small. Rookie mistake.
Anne: Oh, me, me!
Anne: Oh, my gosh! I can't believe that it's you!
Anne: Oh, my gosh! We have to save her.
Anne: Oh, my gosh. You're here too? I wasn't sure. I woke up all alone and... (gasps) Is Marcy with you? Where have you been? I've missed you so much!
Anne: Oh, no! I know what this is. It's the sudden death round. (breathes deeply) You can do this, Anne. (grunting)
Anne: Oh, no! Y-Your doll-- Uh, I mean, action figure. (pauses) Spranne against the world. Right?
Anne: Oh, no.
Anne: Oh, no. If he loses, he'll be more down than ever.
Anne: Oh, no. Not again. I cannot tell you how many times Sasha and Marcy have tried to give me a makeover!
Anne: Oh, nothin'. I was just thinking. Doesn't this house feel empty to you?
Anne: Oh, nothing.
Anne: Oh, oh... And these are the Plantars.
Anne: Oh, okay.
Anne: Oh, okay. Well, when was the last time someone came down here?
Anne: Oh, pretty much everything.
Anne: Oh, shoot. It's almost 6:00. I gotta go, dude.
Anne: Oh, shoot. No, get back here.
Anne: Oh, shoot. We gotta wrap this up. I've gotta sign autographs, kiss tadpoles and do some interviews, all before dinner. So good to talk to you guys. Love you, mean it. Mwah.
Anne: Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Anne: Oh, thank frog.
Anne: Oh, thank goodness.
Anne: Oh, thanks. That's actually a really nice thing to say.
Anne: Oh, that leak has got to be around here somewhere.
Anne: Oh, that sounds great.
Anne: Oh, that's actually really clever.
Anne: Oh, this is nice. (grunts)
Anne: Oh, this is nothing. We just have to keep an eye on her while she's adjusting.
Anne: Oh, uh, hi, Hop Pop.
Anne: Oh, uh, thanks.
Anne: Oh, uh... right back at ya. (gives him a fist bump)
Anne: Oh, we gotta go!
Anne: Oh, we think the exit is that way.
Anne: Oh, wow!
Anne: Oh, wow, what's that place?
Anne: Oh, wow. This place is not to code.
Anne: Oh, yeah! Score one for Anne.
Anne: Oh, yeah, and we'd better hurry, or you might forget.
Anne: Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
Anne: Oh, yeah. Never felt be-- (cries)
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm Anne, and I'm gonna destroy you in this derby thing, as soon as I figure out how to play.
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, at least my head isn't a teakettle. Wait. What?
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, tell you what, then. Why don't you come back in, I don't know, two days or something? And we'll have completely turned this place around.
Anne: Oh, yeah? Well, your gross old mama's tea did this to me!
Anne: Oh, you just fell in love with her, didn't you?
Anne: Oh.
Anne: Oh. (chuckles) Guys, meet my bestie from back home, Sasha!
Anne: Oh. Hey, guys. Just look at this place. Epic, right?
Anne: Oh. Huh. Wasn't expecting that.
Anne: Oh. Um...I don't know. I'm not sure any of this is my business.
Anne: Oh. Yeah, okay.
Anne: Oh...great.
Anne: Ohhh! You're talking about me, right?
Anne: Okay then. (does some anime cuteness pose) Let's start the healing.
Anne: Okay, Marce, me and the Plantars will head back to Wartwood, and when you're ready we can just meet up.
Anne: Okay, Marcy, stay close. (She sees Marcy wander off and blows a raspberry.)
Anne: Okay, first, calm down.
Anne: Okay, good. So, next question.
Anne: Okay, great, see ya.
Anne: Okay, if we can just stay in this formation- Wait!
Anne: Okay, later! Bye!
Anne: Okay, listen well, my young pollywog. Muay Thai is all about...
Anne: Okay, maybe we can't fix it, but someone else can? Someone good with... wood?
Anne: Okay, maybe we could-
Anne: Okay, okay, okay. Enough death already. Sheesh. I'm beginning to think you guys are obsessed.
Anne: Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Anne: Okay, seriously though, on three. One, two...
Anne: Okay, so pink is death by flame, blue is death by crushing. I'm still not following--Marcy!
Anne: Okay, so tonight I'm going to be showing the timeless classic Love Choice, which has always been one of my favorites because--
Anne: Okay, this is a disaster. I never should have made this dumb wager.
Anne: Okay, you're right. I can wait. ..Until you fall asleep.
Anne: Okay.
Anne: Okay. But if I get butt blisters, I'm blaming you.
Anne: Okay. Gotta figure a way out. Hmm. There's only one door, and the toads are outside it. There has to be some other wa-- (sniffs) (gasps) That's it! (grunts) The sewer.
Anne: Okay. She is way too heavy.
Anne: Old things are dumb!
Anne: Ominous.
Anne: One-of-a-kind?
Anne: Oof! Bog, this seems a little extreme.
Anne: Oof, skip school? I don't know, Sash--
Anne: Ooh! (panting, she stumbles backwards until she reaches the edge) Oh! (grunts)
Anne: Ooh! I'll go first. Whoa, you frogs are really flexible, huh? Are you sure you know how to massage a human?
Anne: Ooh! My favorite. (stunned) I've been here too long.
Anne: Ooh! That reminds me. I'm gonna go grab some of that beetle jerky I like. Can't believe I just said that.
Anne: Ooh! Think we'll find some bloated remains?
Anne: Ooh, ooh! Can I drive?
Anne: Ooh, ooh! Eating like a local? Looking like a local? Partying with the locals?
Anne: Ooh, sorry about that, HP.
Anne: Ooh, sorry guys. All the tables are full.
Anne: Ooh-la-la. The little love doves are sneaking off into the woods. You know what that means.
Anne: Ooh. Man, this is a workout. Explain this holiday to me again.
Anne: Ooh. She even included a checklist of things to bring. Let's see here. "Food. Weapons."
Anne: Ooh. That oddity place is still open! How about it?
Anne: Oop, pardon me. Pretty cramped up here, huh?
Anne: Oop, sorry about that. After you, dude.
Anne: Oopsies. Guess I don't know my own strength, right, guys? You guys okay? What's the big deal? It's just one cane.
Anne: Or maybe they just had bad handwriting. Come on. Don't be a buzzkill. Ooh, that's nice. Hey, what are you doing?
Anne: Or maybe...
Anne: Order up. Enjoy!
Anne: Our attacks have no effect.
Anne: Ow!
Anne: Ow! Careful! I'm pretty sure those ticks caused internal damage.
Anne: Ow! Hey.
Anne: Ow! Whoo! Both flags captured!
Anne: Pad See Ew, you later.
Anne: Party? What party?
Anne: Pfft!
Anne: Pfft. It's not meddling. It's the right thing to do because it happened in a movie. And movies are never wrong.
Anne: Phew. Think we could set up some shade out here, Hop Pop?
Anne: Pizza is the ultimate dish. You haven't lived until you've shared one with your friends at the mall.
Anne: Pizza? Tacos? Hamburgers? Whoa, you've got ketchup?! It just occurred to me I've been eating bugs for a month.
Anne: Plan B. We're gonna have to sneak Domino 2 inside.
Anne: Please don't tell me where it comes from.
Anne: Please let us in.
Anne: Please stop doing that.
Anne: Please, I insist.
Anne: Please. Please stop ringing that bell.
Anne: Pleasure doing business with ya.
Anne: Polly, I-- (stammers) That's not--I mean, what I mean is--(Screams suddenly as Tuti grabs her from behind.)
Anne: Polly, exclusivity. It's your job to decide who gets into the party and who doesn't.
Anne: Polly, you are going to love this.
Anne: Polly, you're up.
Anne: Preach! Wait, what?
Anne: Pretty.
Anne: Prisoners, I know. And it's worse than that. They're planning to execute Hop Pop!
Anne: Pshh. That's ridiculous.
Anne: Pssh! Of course we get along. We're Sprig and Anne.
Anne: Psst.
Anne: Quick! Grab those power-ups!
Anne: Ready?
Anne: Really?
Anne: Really? But Duckweed's a newt, Toadstool's a toad, and you two have been happily living in Wartwood for years.
Anne: Really? Maybe someone there will know how my music box works.
Anne: Really? You know you lost, right? Are you in shock? Is he in shock?
Anne: Recharged? How?
Anne: Ree, ree, ree! Grubhog Two. The Reckoning! And, cue the applause.
Anne: Right!
Anne: Right, right, right, right. Okay, guys, listen up. A great party has three ingredients: entertainment, exclusivity, and spectacle. Hop Pop, you're in charge of entertainment. I dub thee Master of Ceremonies.
Anne: Right. Dinner.
Anne: Right. Sometimes I forget about the whole "I'm a freak in this world!!" thing.
Anne: Roommates? Heck yeah! (They bump each other.)
Anne: Rope bridge? More like nope bridge.
Anne: Run!
Anne: Runners on your mark, get set... (blows her whistle)
Anne: Sasha and the Sharps are back, baby!
Anne: Sasha!
Anne: Sasha! The toads! I gotta go help my fr--
Anne: Sasha, I'd really like to, but--
Anne: Sasha, Marcy, I hope you guys are okay, because I am.
Anne: Sasha, meet the Plantars. This is Hop Pop.
Anne: Sasha, please! There has to be another way! Oh!
Anne: Sasha, that was awesome. I'm so psyched you joined us.
Anne: Sasha, what do you think?
Anne: Sasha.
Anne: Sasha?!
Anne: Save it, you crook. I just have one more question for you. (pause for a bit) Was the goatee even real?
Anne: Say what now?
Anne: Say what?
Anne: Sayonara, Domino 2.
Anne: Says here this is Polliana's training simulator.
Anne: School's out, teach.
Anne: Second wind!
Anne: Second, maybe we can track this thief down. Quick. Look for clues. Well, well, well. What do we have here?
Anne: See for yourself, dude.
Anne: See you, Doris!
Anne: See you, Ivy! Well, looks like we found our thief.
Anne: Selling it.
Anne: Seriously, let us handle this. You'll be safer in the back.
Anne: Seriously. No boom shrooms.
Anne: Seriously?
Anne: Seriously? This is hu-yuge. You won't be disappointed, dude.
Anne: She did it!
Anne: She'd say "Move on."
Anne: Sheesh. Tell me how you really feel.
Anne: Shh. Do you hear something?
Anne: Shower?!
Anne: Sleep tight, my precious baby angel.
Anne: So how about it, big guy? We're free, right?
Anne: So much for Sasha and the Sharps. Who's gonna do the guitar solo now?
Anne: So that's what a unicorn tastes like. Corn syrup. (phone chimes) Huh?
Anne: So whoever bought a loaf is a suspect.
Anne: So you've been lying to me? This whole time?
Anne: So, Duckweed. Guess you got a bad review to write, huh?
Anne: So, Sprig, would you rather sweat melted cheese or always smell like skunk?
Anne: So, are you like a big deal here or something?
Anne: So, did you like the food?
Anne: So, how does this work? Do we remind Wally how much he owes or--
Anne: So, that's pretty much it. You're all caught up.
Anne: So, uh, what did the mayor want?
Anne: So, what do we do?
Anne: So, what now?
Anne: So, what you making over there, Hop Pop? Sock gumbo?
Anne: So, why not keep an eye on him as he's sitting next to us? On a ride.
Anne: So, you love Suspicion Island, huh?
Anne: So. Turns out tonight's events were a tad traumatic.
Anne: So... Walliam, what's going on here? I thought you were a fun-loving tramp, not some little rich boy.
Anne: So...that was a little too much bad cop.
Anne: So? What do you think, Hop Pop? Better than that boring stuff you read to us, right?
Anne: Some of us even sound different.
Anne: Some other time, Gertie!
Anne: Something's got my leg!
Anne: Sometimes I wonder why I even bother putting up with you at all!
Anne: Sorry I tried to rush you into confessing your love to Ivy. You do that when you're good and ready.
Anne: Sorry, I was caught up in this whole mob situation. Luckily the Plantars were there to help me and--
Anne: Sorry, I'm just so competitive!
Anne: Sorry, dude, you don't understand. I really gotta go.
Anne: Sorry, dude. And if case you didn't hear, we're responsible for you.
Anne: Sorry, sorry. I am amped!
Anne: Sorry. (Chuckles) Marauders?
Anne: Sounds harmless. Can I honk the horn?
Anne: Sounds like it's worth a shot. So, how far away is this bug, HP?
Anne: Sounds like someone else can't sleep either.
Anne: Spit, dude. Spit like you've never spit before. Break that record, and save this family.
Anne: Sprig!
Anne: Sprig! (sighs)
Anne: Sprig! Hurry up and help me!
Anne: Sprig! Vengeance! Take this and this! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! (Shw's thrown into the lake. She gasps when the water snake appears above her, only to start emitting smoke from its mouth and spitting a screaming Sprig out.)
Anne: Sprig! You all right, buddy? What the heck is going on out there?
Anne: Sprig, I'm just slowing you down, buddy. Get out of here. This was my fault anyway. I should have listened to you.
Anne: Sprig, I'm so sorry.
Anne: Sprig, buddy, just tell Hop Pop how you really feel. Drop that truth bomb. (imitates explosion)
Anne: Sprig, come on! Hurry, hurry!
Anne: Sprig, please! I need your help to make this party amazing.
Anne: Sprig, that wasn't bad cop. That was sad cop. You gotta get mad, man!
Anne: Sprig, where have you been? And who is the strange man attached to you?
Anne: Sprig, work on that proposal. Get some confidence. Come on. (to Loggle) Loggle! I'm gonna need you to re-do that statue. Make it cooler.
Anne: Sprig, you coming?
Anne: Sprig, you have the most important job of all: the spectacle.
Anne: Sprig, you wanna know the best thing about friendship? When you got your friends by your side, anything is possible. Whatever you want, a real friend will help you get. And you know what I want?
Anne: Sprig.
Anne: Sprig? Wait. How did you get out?
Anne: Stay back!
Anne: Stick to physical comedy. Got it. (She punches herself in the face.)
Anne: Stop right there, you-- you... thief? Huh?
Anne: Stop!
Anne: Stop. (sighs, sniffs) Look, I can't be here right now.
Anne: Stumpy! The lemon!
Anne: Stumpy, I know I got carried away, but we can do this. The Boonchuy family pride is at stake. What do you say?
Anne: Stumpy, you gotta throw that slop out and replace it with somethin' fancier. Like, I don't know. Sashimi.
Anne: Stupid non-webbed human hands.
Anne: Super wrong.
Anne: Sure. I mean, it's busted.
Anne: Teachers. They just don't like me. Probably cuz they're jealous of my carefree spirit.
Anne: Termites! Why would a woodsmith have termites?
Anne: Thank you. It's perfect.
Anne: Thanks for believing in me, Sprig.
Anne: Thanks for helping me, guys.
Anne: Thanks for sticking with me, even when the attention got to my head.
Anne: Thanks, Chad, local glass artisan.
Anne: Thanks, Hop Pop.
Anne: Thanks, Hop Pop. So you're not mad about the cane?
Anne: Thanks, Marcy.
Anne: Thanks, Mayor.
Anne: Thanks, Sash.
Anne: Thanks, Sprig. That means a lot to me.
Anne: Thanks, Sprig. That was a close one.
Anne: Thanks, Stumpy. Put her there. Oh, this feels nice. What is this? Oak? Mahogany?
Anne: Thanks, dude.
Anne: Thanks, you guys. Aah!
Anne: Thanks, you guys. Hey, you know what? I still have the key to the apartment. You guys wanna try out the hot tub before they change the locks?
Anne: Thanks.
Anne: Thanks. I got it.
Anne: That doesn't sound so bad.
Anne: That is called "play biting." Isn't it cute?
Anne: That is called hope. I think we might actually pull this off, dude.
Anne: That is some steampunk-y nonsense right there.
Anne: That last bit was oddly casual!
Anne: That sounds like-
Anne: That thing is not a tree. It's some kind of grody bug!
Anne: That was the day you tried to lock us in the house!
Anne: That was the worst Saturday of my life.
Anne: That woman is everything I want to be. (It is dark when she and Spring return to the farm.)
Anne: That's a cool fact. (blushes) What else ya learn?
Anne: That's a girl. You can do it. Come on.
Anne: That's a toenail clipper.
Anne: That's all great, Marcy, but be careful. When you get this into something, you tend to tune everything else out.
Anne: That's good.
Anne: That's just how she says "I love you." (kisses)
Anne: That's kinda messed up, man.
Anne: That's literally the opposite of what I just said.
Anne: That's ridiculous! Tritonio's a good dude who believes in me. I think we should do it.
Anne: That's ridiculous. Trust me. I know cats.
Anne: That's right. I'm the ultimate oddity, baby! I'll make you a deal. I'll be your special attraction for one day only.
Anne: That's the spirit, Hop Pop.
Anne: That's what I like to hear. Hyah! (Bessie starts to move fast as Anne and Sprig whoop with joy. Mrs. Croaker is then seen riding her ladybug.)
Anne: That's what I'm talking about.
Anne: That's... a good thing!
Anne: The Bogwater Wars of '48. The Western Toad invasion of '53. Man, she was in a lot of battles.
Anne: The baker, huh? You have a nice day, sir. (Grabs a bag of donuts and puts a coin on the counter.) Keep the change, kid.
Anne: The entrance to the third temple.
Anne: The ingredients! Everything we've worked for!
Anne: The music box. I can't lose it.
Anne: The one on your prize wall!
Anne: The others got caught! We gotta get back down there.
Anne: The shut off switch is by the exit on the other side.
Anne: The townspeople like me. They really, really like me.
Anne: The what now?
Anne: Then what do we do?
Anne: Then why did you lie?
Anne: There he is!
Anne: There isn't much time. Let's go home and make one of your old recipes, Hop Pop.
Anne: There it is. We did it, guys. Big T is gonna be so proud of us.
Anne: There was a moving fireplace.
Anne: There we go. Presenting... one grubhog!
Anne: There you go. Now you're getting it.
Anne: There's a big monster.
Anne: There's gotta be something we can do. Think!
Anne: These lips be zipped.
Anne: They're actually pretty great once you get to know them. (chuckles) I've been living in their basement since I got here.
Anne: They're fine. They're just blowing off steam. I mean, at least they don't have their weapons.
Anne: They're not just frogs. (picks up sword) THEY'RE MY
Anne: They're too fast. We can't fight them underwater. (She sees her wet blanket and pillows floating.) Huh. Hey, Sprig. You set 'em up... (She takes a pillow and gives Sprig one.)
Anne: This feels... perfect! (raises her fists)
Anne: This hand?
Anne: This is gonna be...
Anne: This is just like an Internet message board...but IRL.
Anne: This is just like when I'd go traveling with my mom.
Anne: This is like a city, city.
Anne: This is not gonna go well.
Anne: This is so exciting. I wonder what their ship name will be. Ivig? Sprigivy?
Anne: This is the last time we let Hop Pop pick the activity.
Anne: This isn't collaboration, it's a hostile takeover. Why do things always have to be your way?
Anne: This place seems pretty cool to me.
Anne: This time, I'm gonna experience the city the way the locals do! Not sit on a bus like some dumb tourist!
Anne: This trip is gonna take us beyond the valley, Sprig. Who knows what we'll run into out there? (She bangs her head on the low door.) Ow.
Anne: This wasn't my fault.
Anne: This world is messed up.
Anne: Those newts and toads are wearing Andrias armor. How could anyone choose to be on Andrias's side?
Anne: Thought you'd never ask.
Anne: Till the end.
Anne: To a house?
Anne: To the Doom Tree, everyone.
Anne: Toad what?
Anne: Too much?
Anne: Totally feel for you, dude. I had the same issue with a girl named Jamie Krieger back home. My advice? Just let it go.
Anne: Toying with them. Wait a second.
Anne: Tritonio!
Anne: Tritonio, can I ask you something? Why don't you like me?
Anne: Tritonio, let's keep it positive. All ideas are welcome here.
Anne: Tritonio, what are you doing?
Anne: Trust me, guys. You gotta pace yourself with this stuff.
Anne: Trust me, it's a thing. Oooh! They have "campfire!"
Anne: Trust me. It's big. And that Curator guy's gonna give it to me. All I have to do is be the museum's main attraction for a day.
Anne: Trusting you was a mistake, but you've made a huge mistake, too.
Anne: Turnip with a face.
Anne: Turns out Hop Pop's been inspiring rebellions all across the valley. Blah, blah, it's some political nonsense.
Anne: Tuti, huh? Well, we're here for that full body massage.
Anne: Twenty coppers? No one's gonna buy that--
Anne: Ugh!
Anne: Ugh! Adults are all the same. Curfews. Rules. Old.
Anne: Ugh! Are you kidding?
Anne: Ugh! Frogs are the worst.
Anne: Ugh! Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna pass. (She gently pushes her bowl ahead.)
Anne: Ugh, I thought you were trying to be my friend.
Anne: Ugh, what'd I tell you? The guy's totally picking on me.
Anne: Ugh, you said it. Can't believe there was nothing in the archives about my music box.
Anne: Ugh.
Anne: Ugh. I'll be old before I finish reading this thing.
Anne: Ugh. Politics are the worst.
Anne: Ugh. Yes, sir!
Anne: Uh, Marbles, this sounds pretty dangerous. Yeah, why don't you leave the mission to me and the Plantars? We did stuff like this all the time in the valley. (grunts)
Anne: Uh, Sprig, why is he changing color?
Anne: Uh, any ideas? Ah! What are you doing?
Anne: Uh, can you deliver this note to the Plantars?
Anne: Uh, come again?
Anne: Uh, dang right it ain't.
Anne: Uh, did the tree just scream?
Anne: Uh, does the corn thief kinda sound like Sprig to you?
Anne: Uh, hello? Anyone here? Well, this place seems nice.
Anne: Uh, hey, guys.
Anne: Uh, no.
Anne: Uh, okay, so--
Anne: Uh, okay.
Anne: Uh, should we be watching this?
Anne: Uh, so they're not gonna eat us?
Anne: Uh, so where am I gonna sleep?
Anne: Uh, sorry about that. He's new to this.
Anne: Uh, what just happened?
Anne: Uh, what now? Oh! Oh!
Anne: Uh, yeah, you need help, bud. But not with this.
Anne: Uh, yeah?
Anne: Uh-huh. I'm going to go hide in the basement until this clears up.
Anne: Uh-oh.
Anne: Uh...
Anne: Uh... (chuckles) Well, of course I did... Run, Polly!
Anne: Uh... Hello? Uh, anything in here about this predator? Oh, there we go. Aw, it's actually pretty cute.
Anne: Uh... I have to, uh... go to the roomrest, uh, the restroom. (laughs, bumps into the Sasha bust) Whoa. (stands the bust back up) Stay. BRB.
Anne: Uh... Okay.
Anne: Uh... Sasha's been my friend since kindergarten. If she says it's fine, it's fine.
Anne: Uh... okay. Come on, Anne. Let me see that power pose!
Anne: Uhhh! The nights were the hardest.
Anne: Um, guys? (struggles) I'm stuck!
Anne: Um, saving you from a giant rock that was about to crush you?
Anne: Unbelievable.
Anne: Understood.
Anne: Up top!
Anne: Very wrong.
Anne: Wait a second. (gasps) Guys, this isn't just a door. It's a puzzle! All right, let's do this. (gasps) There, I did it!
Anne: Wait a second. Are you jealous I think they're cool?
Anne: Wait a second. Who's that?
Anne: Wait, Sash? Marcy and I have done these temples, and there's always some kind of catch. Let's just search the room before we try that thing.
Anne: Wait, WHAT?
Anne: Wait, seriously?
Anne: Wait, what do you mean "thief"? I totally paid.
Anne: Wait, what!? But you said your contacts were gonna--
Anne: Wait, what?
Anne: Wait, what? We cannot let them waste this chance. They say nine out of ten people stay up at night regretting missed romantic opportunities. Nine out of ten!
Anne: Wait, you guys have a message board?
Anne: Wait, you guys read its guts?
Anne: Wait. Huh?
Anne: Wait. I know that voice. Tritonio. I should have known.
Anne: Wait? My friends are in trouble, and here we are sparring.
Anne: Wally, how long has that been there?
Anne: Wally, what did you do?!
Anne: Wally.
Anne: Want to do the honors? I guess that's that. Should we open it?
Anne: War of the Warlocks. That''s right! Marcy made us watch at every sleepover.
Anne: Was that Hop Pop?
Anne: Was the artist your mom by any chance?
Anne: Way to go, Bessie! You are the queen of the road.
Anne: We can still see you!
Anne: We did it?
Anne: We did, didn't we? Uh, this is weird, but... any chance I could squeeze in there?
Anne: We didn't dive in. You pushed us.
Anne: We had your family history all wrong, guys. The Plantars weren't just farmers.
Anne: We have no choice. I'll stay here with Bessie while you hitch a ride back to the farm and... (groans) ... go get Hop Pop.
Anne: We need power. Electricity.
Anne: We totally got this!
Anne: We'll have a way home?
Anne: We'll have to sit in a chicken coop?
Anne: We'll manage, dude. Somehow.
Anne: We'll never make it.
Anne: We're okay! We landed on books!
Anne: We're stuck.
Anne: Welcome, Polly, to the bowels of the city.
Anne: Welcome, brother, to the church of cute.
Anne: Welcome, my friends, to the best Frog of the Year party ever!
Anne: Well can you blame me? Oh! Why would I trust you? It wasn't just Toad Tower, Sasha. You've been pushing me around my whole life.
Anne: Well, I don't "have it, have it." Hop Pop left it with some contacts to see what they could learn about it.
Anne: Well, I don't wanna tell you, "I told you so." But--
Anne: Well, I guess that makes sense.
Anne: Well, I'm scarred for life.
Anne: Well, at least the ingredients are safe. No!
Anne: Well, at least we brought them together to clear the air, right?
Anne: Well, guess we better clean this place up. Again. Stumpy, I'm sorry about all this. I took things way too far.
Anne: Well, hey, now.
Anne: Well, hey, they are missin' out. Come on.
Anne: Well, howdy there, baker. Nice pile of bricks you got here. Listen I wanted to ask you--
Anne: Well, if I'm the princess, then you're the king of bad cooking. (chuckles)
Anne: Well, if we can't share a pizza, at least we can share this. And you know, honestly, this isn't so bad... Hey, what the heck? What was that?
Anne: Well, it was worth a shot.
Anne: Well, it zapped me here, so, yeah. It's pretty much my only lead. (opens the music box) Really looking forward to finding someone who can help me fix this thing.
Anne: Well, maybe this will cheer you up. Pa-pow!
Anne: Well, now that that's over, you guys seen Hop Pop?
Anne: Well, that was intense.
Anne: Well, that's the end of that. Now you and Ivy can go back to being just friends.
Anne: Well, then come on. Let's step up our game and demolish this old man!
Anne: Well, then, let's grub and go there to catch our thief.
Anne: Well, this is what friends do. Remember? They help each other get the things they want.
Anne: Well, what does a little lizard like you know about anything? Besides, my parents ran a restaurant back home, so I know what I'm talking about.
Anne: Well, whatever happens next, one thing's for sure. (brings the family in for a hug) If we're together, I know we'll be all right.
Anne: Well, whatever it is, all yours, Marbles. (grunts, screams)
Anne: Well, whatever you pick, we'll be behind you, dude.
Anne: Well, yeah. But--
Anne: Well... all right. I gotta be home by 6:00, though. My parents are throwing a big party and they really want me to be there.
Anne: Well?
Anne: Welp, as much as I'd love to help, not gonna find any of my ancestors on your shrub, so...
Anne: Welp, that's everyone. Heh, that was surprisingly easy. (She proceeds to dab.) Town protector. Yea-yuh! And now all I have to do is watch 'em. (She sits down leaning on a frozen frog only for it to slide away. She yells and goes after it.)
Anne: Wha... When did you? How did you?
Anne: What about that time you told me not to care what people think about you?
Anne: What do we do?
Anne: What do you mean? I trust you.
Anne: What do you say, Sprig? Why fish when you can fly?
Anne: What do you wanna start with? Change the menu, redecorate... Burn this place to the ground and start over?
Anne: What happened to "Look away from the fancy?"
Anne: What is happening?
Anne: What the heck is going on?
Anne: What the heck is that? Domino 2, where are you? Baby precious!
Anne: What the heck is this?!
Anne: What the heck, Wally?
Anne: What the heck, dude? You ditched me? And now I find you rubbing elbows with the local deadbeat?
Anne: What the--
Anne: What the--(groans)
Anne: What was that?
Anne: What you got there, Sash?
Anne: What's it gonna take to get rid of this thing? (grunts)
Anne: What's that sound?
Anne: What's the matter, Hop Pop? Frog in your throat?
Anne: What?
Anne: What? Are you crazy?
Anne: What? Haven't you ever had a pillow fight before--
Anne: What? How so?
Anne: What? I thought they were all romantic and mate for life.
Anne: What? It was like a swamp sauna in here. Maybe Sprig just needs another blanket.
Anne: What? No! I might be mad at you, but I don't wanna hurt you!
Anne: What? No! You've got a real chance to win.
Anne: What? No, guys, it's not a disease. These are pimples. It's just a human thing.
Anne: What? What does that mean?
Anne: What? Who would trap us in here?
Anne: What? Why not?
Anne: Whew! Who knew leeches could run so fast?
Anne: Whew, tough break, you guys. Hey, do you think I can make this?
Anne: Which means, it's time for us to join up with our newt and toad allies. Woooo!
Anne: Who are those guys?
Anne: Who knew there was a bug that tastes just like chocolate? Why didn't anyone tell me sooner?
Anne: Who would've thought us working together after everything has happened?
Anne: Who wouldn't be? Now let's go catch that thief.
Anne: Whoa!
Anne: Whoa! (screams, chuckles, gasps)
Anne: Whoa! Cool.
Anne: Whoa! No, wait! Come back!
Anne: Whoa! This is awesome. And to think just yesterday people were treating me like a monster. Look at me now, baby.
Anne: Whoa! What happened in here? (It is revealed that the whole room flooded.)
Anne: Whoa! Whoa!
Anne: Whoa, I just realized, we've never done a sleepover without Sasha.
Anne: Whoa, dude. What are you doing?
Anne: Whoa, look at this place!
Anne: Whoa, this is gross. Let's do this thing, Bessie.
Anne: Whoa, whoa, girl. Easy. What's wrong?
Anne: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there, Hop Pop. They're full or traps and super hard but satisfying puzzles.
Anne: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're just gonna leave that there? Someone's gonna steal it.
Anne: Whoa, whoa. Don't cry. I'm not a monster. I'm just weird. See? (She wiggles her nose, then her ears and strikes a pose.) Ta-da! (winks)
Anne: Whoa-whoa. "Dangerous vegetables"? Come on!
Anne: Whoa.
Anne: Whoa. (Seeing Sprig patting her pillow) Awesome digs, Sprig.
Anne: Whoa. Are you guys okay?
Anne: Whoa. Fancy! So about that Skip Man...
Anne: Whoa. Is this my mark? Should I hit it? I'm gonna hit it! Wha-bam!!
Anne: Whoa. It's beautiful. You ready, dude? Yeah! Whoa-ho!
Anne: Whoa. Look at this place. It's just like the outdoor mega mall from back home.
Anne: Whoa. Looks like Domino 2 isn't the only thing purring. Come on. Let's go grab some grub.
Anne: Whoa. Oh, wow. This looks unsafe. We have to go down there.
Anne: Whoa. Sounds like that you really need to be alone with this sandwich, HP.
Anne: Whoa. That was--
Anne: Whoa. What was that?
Anne: Whoa. You got that for two coppers?
Anne: Whoa...
Anne: Whoo!
Anne: Whoo! Happiness, thy name is solitude.
Anne: Whoo! It's hot in here!
Anne: Whoo! Love that!
Anne: Whoo! Man, this snail is fast.
Anne: Whoo! Top score. (sighs) Phew!
Anne: Whoo-hoo!
Anne: Whoo-hoo! Come on, everyone. Let's bring the thunder.
Anne: Why do you keep doing that?
Anne: Why does Grime always get to do the good news?
Anne: Why not Hop Pop and Polly? Seems like a winning combo to me.
Anne: Why would I fall asleep first? Aren't you like 100 years old? (She leaves and he follows.)
Anne: Why? Why?
Anne: Why? You want in? You wanna come?
Anne: Will you please stop pulling levers?
Anne: Will you, uh... Will you give us a moment? Stay right there!
Anne: Win?
Anne: Wish list?
Anne: With us still inside? We're not doing that.
Anne: Work with you? Not gonna happen. I'll save them myself! Whoa. Whoa!
Anne: Worry about yourself. I'll be fine. I just need a little boost is all.
Anne: Would you help me for one of these? (pulls a candy bar out of her pocket)
Anne: Wouldn't it be nice to have a sweet, fuzzy, loving critter around?
Anne: Wouldn't you like to know.
Anne: Wow! Thanks, everyone. I don't know what to say.
Anne: Wow, Sash. This is so surreal. I can't believe you're really here.
Anne: Wow, cool. Hey, mind if the, uh, Plantars come along?
Anne: Wow, thanks buddy.
Anne: Wow. I feel lighter somehow, more... free.
Anne: Wow. Marcy hasn't just changed, she's flourished. I've never seen her so happy.
Anne: Wow. People around here really seem to like Sprig.
Anne: Wow. You were right. Looks like they could
Anne: Yeah these are solid ideas. But, it's just not my song anymore. The lyrics are different, the melody is different. It's just different.
Anne: Yeah, I can see that. Nice toy boat.
Anne: Yeah, Sprig?
Anne: Yeah, and I think I know why. Hey, you okay?
Anne: Yeah, but, but...
Anne: Yeah, but...
Anne: Yeah, dude. I'm on a winning streak.
Anne: Yeah, dude. Sorry about that.
Anne: Yeah, gotta keep that doll out of harms way-- (Being hit in the stomach) Ooh!
Anne: Yeah, it was amazing.
Anne: Yeah, it's gone. (sighs) I'm so sorry, you guys. I had no right to put you all in danger, no matter how much I miss my cat. I hope you understand.
Anne: Yeah, sure. Why not? Here. Now go.
Anne: Yeah, that didn't sound as cool as I wanted it to.
Anne: Yeah, that is peony.
Anne: Yeah, we did. And now... (puts the music box in her backpack) we're through here.
Anne: Yeah, what gives? Let's just use that sweet bling-bling from the king-king.
Anne: Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Anne: Yeah-ah!
Anne: Yeah-uh! (surprised) Wait, you have hair? Hey, sorry about your hat. Oh, there it is.
Anne: Yeah-uh! Bizarre Bazaar, here we come. (puts the music box in her backpack) Okay, which way?
Anne: Yeah.
Anne: Yeah. Fair enough. Research it is.
Anne: Yeah. Guys, I hate to say it, but this temple quest may be more dangerous than we thought.
Anne: Yeah. Just wondering, what brings you here to Wartwood?
Anne: Yeah. We're kinda similar that way. You're always going on about the old days, I'm always going on about back home.
Anne: Yeah. We're the best roommates in the history of roommates.
Anne: Yeah? Well, maybe I spoke too soon.
Anne: Yeah? Well, where I'm from people fixed their crummy houses.
Anne: Yeesh. Could you like, turn down the creep just a bit?
Anne: Yeesh. What's his problem? (She grabs a cane and hunches over speaking like an old man) I'm Hop Pop, and I cook bad and have a temper problem!
Anne: Yep, you lost me.
Anne: Yep.
Anne: Yep. That's, uh, that's pretty much what just happened. Uh, me and my big mouth.
Anne: Yes!
Anne: Yes! In your face, Snapes. (grunts) Man. This is actually pretty good. (She takes some leaves and chews on them.) And I need to stop eating leaves. (Meanwhile, Sprig is holding Archie while humming.)
Anne: Yes! Spranne is back and better than before!
Anne: Yes! Whoo!
Anne: Yes, I do.
Anne: Yes, please. Wow, haven't come across a species like you before.
Anne: Yes, you do.
Anne: Yes. Yes, Sprig. Let it flow!
Anne: Yo guys! Check it out! I got a Mail-Fly message! Look how cute he is.
Anne: Yo, Sash. Sick room's over here.
Anne: You can do it!
Anne: You can keep that.
Anne: You could at least cover it up or something.
Anne: You did it!
Anne: You didn't tell me you were leaving the valley, you scamp.
Anne: You go, girl. (She hugs Bessie's shell and her tears run down it.) You noble, noble creature. Man. This is messing me up. (sniffles) Now let's see. Where was I? (reading) "The reason Bessie had hidden in her shell was now very clear to me. A predator was close. And not just any predator. A natural enemy of snails."
Anne: You got it, HP.
Anne: You got it, HP. My lips are sealed.
Anne: You gotta dig deep, dude. Think about what that thief took from you. Your shell. Your gift. Your future with Ivy. The frog of your dreams!
Anne: You gotta let us in.
Anne: You guys are really close to my face right now.
Anne: You guys don't get it. And Tritonio's a teacher, enemy of all that is good.
Anne: You guys think Wartwood is ready for a "Sasha and the Sharps" reunion?
Anne: You guys want cantaloupe flavor or bubblegum?
Anne: You guys were at each other's throats just a second ago. Are you seriously over this already?
Anne: You guys would like her. She's got fire. Sprig: Ooh!
Anne: You keep your claws off that snail. Better yet...get off our property.
Anne: You know what? Tritonio might have been a crook, but he was onto something. When I get home, I'm gonna give my teachers another chance.
Anne: You know what? You can keep it.
Anne: You know, Hop Pop, back home we call that having a friend's back.
Anne: You know, Hop Pop, back home we call this a family tree.
Anne: You know, in the past, I would have said yes, but I think I'm getting a little too old for that nonsense.
Anne: You know, my parents actually owned a Thai restaurant back home. (She pulls out her phone, which shows a picture of Domino.) Ah, whoops. Hold on. (Shuffles through her photos until one of Thai Go is shown.) I used to work there all the time and help out. I hope they're doing okay without me.
Anne: You know, zap zap?
Anne: You know. A cop, po-po, five-oh, doughnut munchers?
Anne: You little genius, you.
Anne: You mean the mayor?
Anne: You mean--
Anne: You passed the interview?
Anne: You really mean it-- Guys, now!
Anne: You set 'em up, and I'll knock 'em down.
Anne: You taught me how to fight.
Anne: You think?
Anne: You told me this is what you wanted. (jigs past him and stops in front) You said, "I wish they could see me in Wartwood."
Anne: You too, dude! Oh, uh, I mean... milady.
Anne: You too?
Anne: You'll get it one day, when you have someone to look after.
Anne: You'll never take me alive!
Anne: You're alive. What did you do?
Anne: You're right, Sash. It's time for... (distorted voice) team building exercises.
Anne: You're right. We can't. But you can. I believe in you.
Anne: You're safe now, little fella. (screams)
Anne: You're telling me, if push came to shove, you'd even leave these guys in the dust?
Anne: You're throwing me out. You know, like you said you would.
Anne: You're too eager. My instructor always used to tell me: "Jai yen yen." It means to have patience and a cool heart.
Anne: You've won prizes?
Anne: You.
Anne: You?
Anne: Your book? That's it. Is there anything in the old ways that could help us right now?
Anne: Your foot's about to be a pancake. (grunts)
Anne: Yup!
Anne: Yup.
Anne: Yup. A legendary party needs a legendary spectacle. Can you imagine how excited party-goers will be to see true love blossom before their eyes?
Anne: Yup. Now let's go rob an old man!
Anne: Yup. With the box charged, we'll be heading to Newtopia tomorrow for the king to send us home. Everyone, you've all done so much for me, and I'll miss you more than you could ever know.
Anne: pizza!
Anne: swasdiikha (swadi-ka; translates to "good evening" or "hello" in Thai) (as she does a wai) And welcome to Stumpy's! Wartwood's first frog-Thai fusion restaurant, now with napkins.
Anne:: I get it. Frog Thanksgiving. You even have a turkey.
Announcer: The Grubhog Ceremony will begin presently.
Archie: (panting)
Archie: (snarls)
Archie: (squeaks, pants)
Archie: (whimpers)
Arguing frogs: My seat!
Armies: Ugh!
Baby Sister #2: Are you a weirdo?
Band player: Uh, yeah. We've been hitting it, but okay.
Barry: Dang right, I do. Turns out I've got a sweet tooth for anarchy.
Barry: Holy... (crows)
Barry: Look around you, toots. The whole world is insane, but that suits us, don't it, Brian?
Barry: See? Turns out the end of the world is sweet! (Cackles)
Barry: We're going to sell you sugarplums to Andrias' army. They pay extra for resistance frogs.
Bartley: I'm telling you, Branson, what we need is a direct frontal assault.
Baskins: "There I was, about to split the case of the century wide open. The person behind it all was right behind this chair, and it was my job to deliver justice with my fists."
Beatrix (blush embarrassment): Right.
Beatrix (jumps out of the ant vehicle on top): Enough pleasantries! I agree to fight alongside you frogs, but I draw the line at newts. They'll steal your sword and then stab me in the back with us.
Beatrix (on her spider vehicle): Toads! (pulls out her ax) Battle formation!
Beatrix (while she and the toads do the pose): Excuse me, what's the point of this?
Beatrix's Ant Vehicle: (roars)
Beatrix: (clears throat) We came up with a plan!
Beatrix: ...we can draw the attention of its forces. Leaving a window for a small group to sneak in the back door and steal the music box while they're distracted.
Beatrix: Bufo's right. Just because King Andrias is working with a couple of hummuses doesn't mean us toads will go for it.
Beatrix: Definitely smells dead.
Beatrix: Fine. If Anne thinks you can moderate, we'll stay.
Beatrix: HA! A frog with a battle strategy?!
Beatrix: HA! Now we're as bad ideas you cocky newt.
Beatrix: I'm gonna turn your tail into a toothpick.
Beatrix: In the meantime, you have to see that we really do want the same thing to take our world back from that crazy king!
Beatrix: Maybe.
Beatrix: Nicely done, Grimothy.
Beatrix: SWEET SWOBBLER SUSAN!!
Beatrix: That does it! This alliance is over.
Beatrix: What? I have an idea.
Beatrix: Yeah, that's a suicide mission.
Beetle: (shrieks)
Beetle: *chirps*
Bella: (groans)
Bella: (screaming)
Bella: (sighs) Is this it? Is this the rest of my life? Oh, well. If the real world's taught me anything, it's that magic is dead and miracles don't exist.
Bella: Are you winking at that Ferris wheel?
Bella: Did you say, "unlimited funds"?
Bella: Finders keepers!
Bella: Four years of Newtopia University and a mountain of student debt for this?
Bella: Hey, get back here!
Bella: If you're paying, let's make it 1,000.
Bella: Thanks, kid. It's people like you that make me ever so slightly more positive about the future.
Bella: What the... You saved me! Thanks, kid.
Bella: Yes, sir!
Bernardo: Minimalist. Bernardo like.
Bessie (blushes): (chirps)
Bessie: (chirps)
Bessie: (grunts)
Bessie: (purrs)
Bessie: (purrs, chirps)
Bessie: (sees a sheep) *chirps* (goes to the sheep)
Bessie: (sputters)
Bessie: *chirps*
Bessie: *purrs*
Birds: (chirping)
Blair: Yeah, well, you're both wrong. We need to learn how to communicate with our ant brethren and live in sweet, sweet harmony.
Blair: You shut up!
Bog (to Anne): If it was respect you were looking for, you sure lost mine. You've a lot of nerve, I'll give you that. (laughs) We'll be back, Anne, and we won't be alone. (grunts)
Bog: (fingers snap)
Bog: (laughing)
Bog: (laughs)
Bog: Ah! Nothing like cracking your neck after a long drive. Ain't that right?
Bog: All right. First name on the list.
Bog: Anne, the tower didn't get any taxes, okay? And if we didn't get the money, then where is it?
Bog: Anne, they all say they've paid. I don't care what you think you saw. The list don't lie. Now, what should we start with?
Bog: Care to repeat that?
Bog: Come on, Anne!
Bog: Eh, some nut named Hopadiah Plantar.
Bog: Every year, this town sends taxes to the tower. Well, this year, they came up short. So, the Mayor gave us this list of frogs who didn't pay and we're just here to collect. Say, we could use someone like you.
Bog: Good choice. That snail should cover everything. Mire, Fens, Anne, move out.
Bog: Here you go, Anne. Little something extra for you.
Bog: Hyah!
Bog: I don't like your tone, frog. Or did you forget who you're talking to?
Bog: It's just the way we do things here. Plus, it's not like we enjoy it. Now who wants to race to the next house? (laughs)
Bog: Name's Bog. The silent one there is Mire. And Fens here you already met.
Bog: Oh, we're gonna tell the captain everything.
Bog: Sorry, creature. It's just business. (groans) What the--
Bog: Sure are, runt.
Bog: The law's the law, Anne. It can be tough, but this kind of work needs to get done.
Bog: The mayor's list says otherwise. And since you haven't paid, we'll be taking your stuff.
Bog: Tsk, tsk, tsk. How disappointing. Do you know what we do to traitors in the tower, Anne?
Bog: Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. Whoa! What is that? It's some kind of gangly new critter I've never seen before.
Bog: Well met, creature. I don't know what you are, but you've got fire.
Bog: Yeah. You've got inside knowledge of this town. It'll make the whole job go a lot smoother.
Bog: You know, the best part of wearing this badge is how everyone in this town will have to treat you with respect.
Both: (Squealing)
Both: (sighs)
Both: Aha! Ready? One, two, three...
Both: He's gonna kill us!
Both: He's gonna kill us.
Both: I'll save you, Constance!
Both: It's gonna be okay!
Both: Right!
Both: Whoa!
Both: Whoa! Oof!
Boulder-tron: Always, my queen.
Boy 1: Gross!
Boy 2: Gross!
Braddock (whispering): Percy!
Braddock: (chuckles) Oh, well, I do wash with a steel wool brush. It really hurts.
Braddock: (gasps) (She slaps Percy then pulls him into a kiss.)
Braddock: (gasps) Oh, it's gorgeous. You should see the squash--
Braddock: Captain Grime! Captain Grime! Sir! Oh, hey, Sash.
Braddock: Just call us...
Braddock: Not exactly a welcoming crowd.
Braddock: Oh! Right. Yes. We may have a small problem.
Braddock: Sir.
Braddock: That's it! Stick a fork in us. We're done.
Braddock: There.
Braddock: We trusted you, and you didn't care one bit about what happened to us as long as you got what you wanted.
Branson: And I'm telling you, Bartley, a sneak attack is what's called for.
Brian: I used to be a tax accountant. Now I drink the blood of my enemies and eat dessert for breakfast.
Brunton: (speaks in a French accent) Oui, Commander?
Brunton: Anything else, Commander?
Bufo, Beatrix: (both gasp, laugh)
Bufo: Barrel's Hammer? You've finally gone senile, Aldo.
Bufo: No toad has ever gone after the hammer and made it back alive. This I've gotta see.
Bufo: Ooh, that ducky looks nice.
Bufo: So tell us, tell us, who's leading this revolution?
Bufo: Speaking of which, this whole thing is beginning to sound too risky. Guards! Arrest them!
Bufo: Uh, is he asleep or dead?
Bufo: Yeah, I don't think so. We love your vision, but no toad is going to follow the command of a fugitive and his hummus.
Captain Beatrix: Maybe he wants to be surrounded by friends when he gets arrested. What do you think, Aldo?
Captain Bufo: So, the disgraced Captain Grime called this council meeting? Does anyone have any idea why?
Captain Grime: Nice to finally meet you, Anne Boonchuy.
Captain Grime: Take a look at this please, Sasha. It was found far from here, in the South Forest. Now we know that you've been lying to us. (shows an imprisoned Sasha) Now we know that there are more of you.
Carl: (grunting)
Carl: The more the merrier.
Chad: It can't be, Vivica. These pterodactyls are clones of... my dead brother!
Chad: NOOOOO!
Chad: Yep.
Chicka-Lisk (subtitled while crowing): Okay that's just offensive, you guys. Chicka-Lisk, out!
Child: (Coughing in the dust)
Chuck: Ahem.
Chuck: I grew tulips.
Chuck: I grow singin' tulips.
Chuck: I grow tulips.
Chuck: I like tulips.
Cicada: (neighs)
Concierge: (gasps) My mistake, sir! (to Bella) You, on the other hand, are fired!
Concierge: Five minutes left on your break, Bella.
Concierge: My best?
Concierge: The king? Uh, yes, absolutely. Sound good, Bella?
Concierge: You two are in big trouble! Nobody rides the Hemisphere Ferris wheel for free!
Constance: I know I said I liked Hunter, but I can't help but be drawn to you as well, Alastair.
Constance: It is now time for me to make my love choice. I choose... I choose...
Constance: Oh, Hunter. I know that together we'll make it through this nightmare.
Cops: Oy, oy, oy!
Criminal: (gasps)
Criminal: How'd you get my phone number?
Crowd (chanting): Puppets! Puppets! Puppets!
Crowd: (distorted) Get up!
Crowd: (gasps)
Crowd: (roars)
Crowd: Aww...
Crowd: Hail Hunter!
Crowd: Hop Pop! Yeah! Whoo!
Crowd: Just start the movie!
Crowd: Two more weeks of winter!
Crumpet: *groans* And now the players will pick their beasts.
Crumpet: All right, folks. This is it. Next goal wins.
Crumpet: Aw. Isn't this great? I just love happy endings. What do you say? How about a song? Always works for me.
Crumpet: Crump Sir Ribbiton has scored the first goal.
Crumpet: Goal! Walliam wins.
Crumpet: Hi-ho, Crumpet the Frog here, and welcome to the official Ribbiton family challenge. A ribbiting game of Beast Polo. Hey, see what I did there? Ribbiting, riveting? Because we're frogs?
Crumpet: Okay, fellas. Let's keep this game cool and friendly-like. Three, two, one. Ee-eee!
Crumpet: Okay. Here comes the ball now!
Crumpet: That beast may be small, but it sure is agile. A goal for Walliam.
Doris: You go get 'em, girl!
Duckweed: Ah!
Duckweed: Amusing. All right, I'll play your little game.
Duckweed: And with 22,000 votes, the entire rest of the Valley, Mayor Toadstool!
Duckweed: Bad...Bad? That was incredible! A food that tries to eat you? The irony, the ecstasy! I simply must tell everyone. To the message board!
Duckweed: Being mayor is a lot like being dropped in the woods naked and forced to find your way home. So that's what we did!
Duckweed: Congratulations, sir.
Duckweed: Eh, define happily.
Duckweed: Ha! Well, what does a creature like you know about running a restaurant?
Duckweed: I mean, seriously, look at this place.
Duckweed: If you knew it was me, you'd probably zhuzh it up a bit, make it a little bit better. But in a disguise, you're just gonna serve me like anyone else.
Duckweed: Ladies and gentlephibians, you know the candidates, you've seen 'em fight monsters. But for the final challenge, you'll see them fight...each other!
Duckweed: My name is Duckweed.
Duckweed: Now you both know the rules. Fight starts as soon as the bell rings.
Duckweed: Oh, a wager, is it? Fine, I'll be back in two days. Looking forward to writing my review and shutting this place down.
Duckweed: Oh, my...What an exotic selection.
Duckweed: Oh, right... No! I found the experience had no cohesion, like one thing was clumsily grafted on top of another. And when I publish my review, your restaurant will be ruined. (laughs) I love my job.
Duckweed: Oh, this? It's kind of a critic thing.
Duckweed: Our first trial is all about strength. The first candidate to mount the beetle wins!
Duckweed: Ready, set, go!
Duckweed: Thank you!
Duckweed: That's a knockout!
Duckweed: The second trial is about sensitivity. Can you figure out what these hatchlings need? A good mayor would.
Duckweed: They can have my table. I am done here.
Duckweed: Uh-huh. It's to guarantee that we get a genuine experience, you know?
Duckweed: Um, yes, there's only one fly in my soup. There should be dozens. I mean, how hard is it to run a restaurant, anyway? You just put food on tables. A tadpole can do it.
Duckweed: Well, folks, that wraps up the trials. Now it's time to tally the votes! With 88 votes, 100% of Wartwood, Hopediah Plantar!
Duckweed: Well, if your parents are anything like you, I'm sure their restaurant was terrible.
Employee: What the-
Employee: Who's responsible for this?
Employee: Yous two! Get over here and clean this up!
Everyone (except Anne and Sasha): Yes ma'am.
Everyone: Sprig!
Felicia: (Chuckles, slightly embarrassed.) Mom.
Felicia: (Showing a spot of dirt on the plate with a magnifying glass) A filthy plate! (She picks up a napkin swan.) And just look at these napkin swans. Their necks are looking pretty sad. (The napkin swan's neck droops.)
Felicia: (chuckles) Oh, come here, you little charmer.
Felicia: (gasps)
Felicia: (groans) Can it, Plantar. This is all your fault. If you taught your grandson proper courtship technique--
Felicia: (screams)
Felicia: (sighs) I can't believe I have raised such an ungrateful and disrespectful daughter!
Felicia: (sighs) I'm so happy we agreed on this merger, Hopadiah. That Sprig of yours looks like a hard worker.
Felicia: (sniffs) Oh, yuck, really?
Felicia: Agreed.
Felicia: Am I crazy, or is he making sense?
Felicia: Classic, clumsy scarecrow.
Felicia: Come along now, Ivy. Let's get you home so I can apologize safely.
Felicia: Don't "but, Mom" me. Come home this instant! (Ivy grunts angrily and punches the tree, knocking Sprig off it.)
Felicia: Don't touch anything.
Felicia: Excuse me, young lady. Where do you think you're going?
Felicia: First things first. We need to evaluate your attention to detail. Now, this was my table setting from this morning. And this was yours. (Ivy's table setting has a tea pot uncovered.)
Felicia: He's so attractive.
Felicia: Hi, Sprig. Thanks for your help in the tea shop the other day.
Felicia: Hop Pop for mayor, everyone.
Felicia: I remember saying you had to finish your chores first.
Felicia: I second that!
Felicia: It means they're abandoning the ritual! If those two don't finish that dance...
Felicia: It's nuanced.
Felicia: Ivy Hibiscus Matcha Sundew! (Ivy looks up and sees three bee-like phone creatures above.) You come home this instant! You're in big trouble, young lady. (One of the bee-like phone creatures lowers next to Ivy and she grabs it by the nose.)
Felicia: Ivy Sundew! (Ivy screams as she falls off the tree and lands with a faceplant. The Glitter Bug then flies away.)
Felicia: Ivy Sundew, I've had it with your disobedience!
Felicia: Ivy, you're late for your tea ceremony lessons.
Felicia: Look, kids, we--
Felicia: Martial arts, eh? Fine. You don't have to take tea lessons anymore, if you can beat me in a martial arts fight. Three rounds. And you only need to win one.
Felicia: My little girl's a woman.
Felicia: Now let's see how good a job you did. (She picks up a plate.) Aha! What's this?
Felicia: Oh, how horrid.
Felicia: Oh, if you're gonna bring it, then bring it.
Felicia: Oh, look at you. Okay, bye.
Felicia: Oh, she said she had something more important to do.
Felicia: Oh, thank frog.
Felicia: Oh, you're just in time. I've got one last box of nails. And they're rusty.
Felicia: Ridiculous.
Felicia: She's one of us.
Felicia: So what do we do?
Felicia: Something about an...
Felicia: The only thing that's garbage is your attitude, young lady. A nice cup of oolong will cure that right up. (She pours some tea.)
Felicia: They most certainly are not! Now fix your shoddy work or you aren't goin' anywhere, young lady.
Felicia: They're beautiful.
Felicia: Up, bup, bup. Should have thought of that before you rushed your chores. (She hears knocking on the door.) Heavens! That'll be the morning rush! (She opens the door and some elderly frogs come in.) Come on in, everyone! My favorite time of day. Oh, Mr. Patterson, is that a new scarf? (Ivy groans with annoyance.)
Felicia: We all pitched in and built you a stand. For giving us something better than produce...
Felicia: You kids are in big trouble!
Felicia: You're just missing that extra something-something. (She puts the cover over the tea pot.) It's the details that count, Ivy. Now, I'll demonstrate. Then you follow. We'll start with folding the swan napkins. (She folds a napkin into a swan and it sparkles. Ivy does the same thing, but it is different than hers.) We all have our off days, I suppose. (Ivy growls.) Next, let's steep the tea. (She spins some tea bags above tea cups. Ivy does the same thing, but one of her tea bags lands in one of the tea cups. Felicia clears her throat.) Careful. Don't break my frog china. (Ivy growls and steam comes out of her ears.) Oh, shoot, did I leave a kettle on? Oh, we'll deal with that in a bit. Now for my favorite part. Changin' the tablecloth! (She spins and places a tablecloth on a table. Ivy only puts hers halfway onto her table.) Ivy, if you're going to do things halfway, we'll just have to start over.
Female Frog: (kicking the chair to pieces) Hi-ya!
Female frog: Amazing, Leader Sprig.
Fens: (cackles) You're about to be a pill bug pancake, you little brat.
Fens: (chuckles)
Fens: (screams)
Fens: I wonder what it tastes like.
Fens: Is that a challenge? (laughs, growls)
Fens: So are we gonna tell the captain about that creature we found?
Fens: Well, how about that thing?
Fens: Whoa, that was awesome.
Fens: Yeah. Needs to get done. Stuff, gotta get it done.
Fern: Seems worth it to me!
Fern: Wow. I wish my hands were scissors. Working at the salon would be a breeze.
Ferraiolo: Buongiorno, Sprig.
Fiddle Leaf: *chirps*
Flashback Anne: Come on, guys! It's time to get...suspicious.
Flower: (yodels)
Flower: Tsk tsk tsk tsk.
Frog #1: Put it right over here.
Frog #2: Just a little touch of goodness.
Frog 1: Whoo-hoo!
Frog 2: Yeah! This is fun.
Frog 3: Prisoners?!
Frog 4: They're gonna eat us!
Frog Soos: (Chuckle) Caught me again, Mr.Ponds!
Frog Soos: Doo doo doo. Say, Mr. Ponds, do you get the feeling that we exist simultaneously in multiple parallel universes, completely unaware of the other's very existence?
Frog child: (giggles) You can't catch me.
Frog: (scoffs)
Frog: *gasps*
Frog: *groaning*
Frog: Aah! Help! Somebody help me!
Frog: Dang right!
Frog: I don't want my mind blown.
Frog: I hear the market has really taken off.
Frog: It talks. Oh, capital.
Frog: Oh, hey, Hopediah.
Frog: Oh, hey. Thanks so much--
Frog: Oh, okay.
Frog: Shh.
Frog: That does it!
Frog: Whoo-hoo!
Frog: Whoo-hoo! (garbled mumbling)
Frog: Yeah!
Frog: Yup. Still up here. Still need help.
Frogs: You people should be ashamed!
Game: You're dead!
Gary: What can I say, I'm dedicated.
Gertie: Got it! Here, grab my arm!
Gertie: Wanna try my new gnatchos, Anne?
Get it together! Here's the plan:
Ginger: And then we'll be older and Maddie will want to play with us again!
Ginger: Boo! Magic is boring!
Ginger: Found you!
Ginger: Maddie!
Ginger: That's what you said yesterday.
Ginger: Why did she want to hang out with that stupid old lady?
Ginger: You wanted us grown up.
Green Frog: Oh, jeez!
Green Toad Soldier: (chuckles while running)
Green Toad Soldier: (crosses the finish line with Toadie) WOO! YES!! (spikes Toadie like a ball) Nailed it!
Greg: Hmm, that's clearly a narwhal-worm being ridden by a hummus, heading straight for us.
Grime (interrupting): What Hop Pop is trying to say is that things will be tense.
Grime (whispering): Get back here, Percy.
Grime (whispering): Percy, come back.
Grime(to Sasha): Unbelievable. This compliment stuff is witchcraft.
Grime: (cackles) Even in this state, those things were no match for me.
Grime: (chuckles)
Grime: (clears throat) My fellow toads. For years, we have kept the kingdom's servants in line. But are we not just servants ourselves? I propose a future where toads overthrow King Andrias, and take our rightful place as rulers of all Amphibia!
Grime: (gasps) The tower! It's coming up too fast. We're going to crash into it. Go left! Go left!
Grime: (grunts) He's earned my respect.
Grime: (laughs) Baby's hungry.
Grime: (laughs) Where did you get moves like that?
Grime: (laughs) Yes! Yes!
Grime: (sighs)
Grime: (sighs) It's no use. Sasha, we've got to get out of here or we'll all die.
Grime: (stammers) Yes?
Grime: (to Sasha): Ahem. Probably should've let you having powers there.
Grime: ...invite you to a banquet!
Grime: After Toad Tower, Sasha and I lost everything.
Grime: Ah, this place is falling apart!
Grime: Ah... Um... Yes.
Grime: Ahem. This piece is dedicated to the serenity of nature.
Grime: All right, troops, listen up.
Grime: And apparently aiding the crown.
Grime: Be that as it may, I still intend to win. Look behind you.
Grime: Begin!
Grime: But we both know I can't stop you. So go ahead, be a vagabond, wandering alone in the wilderness.
Grime: By nerds, she means you guys.
Grime: Close the gates.
Grime: Come on, you cowards. Fight back.
Grime: Creature, fight with me. And together we'll--And she's gone.
Grime: Deal. Now grab every toad you can and head to the safe room.
Grime: Did you need something, soldier?
Grime: Do something!
Grime: Don't lead them here, you fool. Ugh!
Grime: Don't see why not.
Grime: Enough! Now who--
Grime: Frogs of Wartwood! We toads have come here to...
Grime: Good news is we've secured a major shipment of crucial supplies from a wealthy pro-Wartwood elite.
Grime: Good. Because the things we've set into motion cannot be stopped.
Grime: Great grasshopper guts! It's like an elephant tick is standing on my back!
Grime: Ha-ha!
Grime: He has...
Grime: Her problem is that she's my sister. And I may have teased her quite a bit when we were tadpoles.
Grime: Hmm?
Grime: Hmph. (blushes in embarassment as he twirls)
Grime: Hold her steady, boys!
Grime: Hold ranks! Where are you going, you cowards?
Grime: Hyah!
Grime: I don't wanna do Percy.
Grime: I know it hurts. But remember, every dream has its price, and not everyone's willing to pay it. Now come on, soldier. We've got a world to conquer.
Grime: I was thinking... us?
Grime: I'm not afraid of death.
Grime: I'm sorry, cheer what?
Grime: I'm sure you've all heard frogs in the valley are getting unruly. They're questioning our authority. Some towns have even stopped paying their taxes. And do you know why?
Grime: It'll be enough once you start giving me real answers. Until then--
Grime: Just let them go, Sasha. We all have our limits. It looks like they finally hit theirs.
Grime: Kill the torches. Fast!
Grime: Looks like you've got a rebellious seed of your own. You've given me plenty of advice. Now let me give you some. Stamp this out. Make her yield. Fail, and nothing will ever be the same.
Grime: Maybe if any of you had a scrap of courage, we wouldn't be in here cowering like a bunch of--
Grime: Mmm. I don't know.
Grime: No, it won't. Take him to the pain room. (fingers snap)
Grime: No, you imbeciles! You've all gotten soft.
Grime: Not so fast. You're far too dangerous and manipulative to be left to roam free.
Grime: Oh yes. All shall tremble at my performance.
Grime: Oh! Uh, right!
Grime: Oh, Gary. Gary, Gary. Um...Gary never missed a day, even when he was sick.
Grime: Okay. Wow. Um...Head down to the mess hall for some food and a round of beetle mead. You've earned it.
Grime: One eye. I see what you did there.
Grime: Or stay here. Help us rebuild the tower. Perhaps serve as my second-in-command. And when we're done here, you, me, and the entire garrison will march on the valley, restore order, and find your friends. Now, how does that sound?
Grime: Percy's a grubbing idiot.
Grime: Pretty cool, huh? This ends now.
Grime: Quickly.
Grime: Quiet. It's not just a bird. It's a heron, a murderous predator that happens to love the taste of flesh.
Grime: Sasha, no!
Grime: So, these are the valley's strongest warriors. Pathetic! Wait, hold on. Is this guy seriously wearing his breastplate as pants?
Grime: Tell me what?
Grime: That actually works?
Grime: That's enough, Lieutenant.
Grime: The creature can fight. She could be worth something.
Grime: The moment we heard that Anne was here, we rushed over to reunite these two friends and hold a celebration.
Grime: The most important thing right now is that we be very, very quiet.
Grime: Then come, Lieutenant. We have much to discuss.
Grime: There is no other way, creature. Our very way of life is at stake. I don't expect an outsider like you to understand. Seize the traitor, Hopediah Plantar.
Grime: There must be another way to stop it.
Grime: There's plenty more where that came from, and far more loyal than Percy.
Grime: This should be fun. My friends! Instead of a messy free-for-all, I have a splendid idea. How about we settle this (jumps onto a rock) the toad-fashioned way? (snaps fingers)
Grime: To get this valley under control, I need warriors who are fierce, cunning, and above all, ruthless!
Grime: Toads of Toad Tower, today was a great victory. If it weren't for your bravery, the fortress would be lost. You're all heroes!
Grime: Trial by combat! If your champion wins, you all go home, no harm, no foul. But if our champion wins, well...
Grime: Uh...But, when he makes a mistake, he owns it. And he doesn't stop until he makes things right. And because of that...
Grime: Uh...Yes! Braddock is tough. Tough as beetle skin.
Grime: Up here, pheasants!
Grime: Very impressive, Sasha. Always playing Flipwart when everyone else is playing Bog Jump.
Grime: We're ready!
Grime: Well, Lieutenant, I had my doubts, but we did it.
Grime: Well, see, Flipwart and Bog Jump are games, but Flipwart, of course, is far more complicated and... I'm trying to say you're smart!
Grime: What do you suggest, I congratulate them? Give them each an award?
Grime: What do you think you're doing?!
Grime: What the... What?!
Grime: What?
Grime: What? What are you--
Grime: Who is it? What do you want?
Grime: Yeah, it was just one time
Grime: Yeah, no. I'm a solo act.
Grime: Yes. Despite my rough exterior, I really am just an "old softy".
Grime: You haven't forgotten the plan, have you? We only need these jokers to get safely into Newtopia.
Grime: You lot are, without a doubt, the most useless group of toads I have ever seen.
Grime: You're insane and I love it!
Grime: You're not talking about this!
Grime:Yeah, I don't think so.
Grubhog: (oinks and spits acid)
Grubhog: (oinks)
Grubhog: Thank you for saving me, loyal subject.
Guard: Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
Gunther: (Roars and sprouts tusks.)
Gunther: (groans) I hate licorice! (He starts chasing them again.)
Gunther: (groans) Thank you, child. Rage problems. You know how it is. People misjudge me all the time since I can turn into a hulking beast. And it's super annoying, hmm.
Gunther: (growls repeatedly)
Gunther: (growls)
Gunther: (growls) Huh?
Gunther: (laughs) Hopped.
Gunther: Aw!
Gunther: Excuse me?
Gunther: Get out of my house! (growls)
Gunther: Hey!
Gunther: I kill you!
Gunther: Oh, can I help you children?
Gunther: Ooh, chocolate. (munches)
Gunther: Shell?
Gunther: Stop that!
Gunther: Well, I'm from down south. But I had to leave due to an unfortunate misunderstanding.
Gunther: Well, isn't that nice?
Heron: (whimpers)
Hmm. Newtropolitan Gala, tonight 8:00 p.m.
Hop Pop & Anne: Hmph.
Hop Pop & Sprig: (scream)
Hop Pop (OS): Okay, okay, just had to ask.
Hop Pop (OS): You kids sure you don't wanna wear the puffy suits?
Hop Pop (embarrassed yet a bit mad): Oh, ignoring frogs now, eh? Typical. A snobby newt and a bully of a toad. Why am I not surprised?
Hop Pop (flashback): So then you add up your deductibles and... Oop! Guess what, Anne? You're a deductible!
Hop Pop (narrating): Before we knew it, everybody was asking for stuff. So we made a wish list. We hid the list in a special place so we wouldn't forget. And then we forgot it.
Hop Pop (on Bessie with his pitchfork): Come on, frogs! Uh, do the best you can.
Hop Pop's voice: That's what older brothers do, Sprig. They look out for their little sisters.
Hop Pop(emerging from the store): Sorry about the wait, kids.
Hop Pop(tearful): Dang it, you're right. In the end, it's all about love.
Hop Pop(trying to use his glasses to replace the lens): Hey, I should have thought of this sooner.
Hop Pop, Beatrix, Tritonio: CHARGE!!
Hop Pop, Beatrix, and Tritonio: What do you think?
Hop Pop, Polly: (screaming) Oh, no! I gotcha! I gotcha!
Hop Pop, Polly: Uh, you're on fire again.
Hop Pop/Polly: On it!
Hop Pop: "Blam Berry Blitz. The drink that punches you in the face and doesn't stop." Hah! That silly drink won't keep you up! Now, this will keep you up.
Hop Pop: "Only nature facts." Fair. Well, now. Hold on. "Older than the old ways." Now this I gotta read. (He piles several books into his arms.)
Hop Pop: "Runnin' around"? Doin' what?
Hop Pop: "Zap zap"? Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. Quickly! To my study!
Hop Pop: 'Cause you're a pollywog. You're too young to go off on your own.
Hop Pop: (Kicks him away - he falls to the ground.)
Hop Pop: (OS) Please, Anne. (onscreen) I know I lied to you, but trust me. At least long enough to save the kids.
Hop Pop: (Putting Anne's bag on the stair) Don't worry, Anne. I saved your stuff. Except your bed. And your blankets. And your pillow, pencils, T-shirts, hairbrush.
Hop Pop: (Unamused.) Oh. Hey, Monroe.
Hop Pop: (caws) Ta-da! Whoo! I gotta say, that's the first lesson I actually felt good--
Hop Pop: (chuckle) Oh, it gets worse. When I went to dig it up last night, it was gone! Anne saw the whole thing and ran off. I've been waiting all night for her to come back.
Hop Pop: (chuckles nervously)
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Had a feeling you wouldn't last.
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Hear that?
Hop Pop: (chuckles) Yeah. I guess we're even.
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Forgive me for being skeptical, but why the change of heart?
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Kids, will you help me get the fwagon unloaded? Let's give Anne and Marcy some space.
Hop Pop: (clears throat) S-S-Sylvia? Uh...
Hop Pop: (clears throat) Would anyone like to hear my idea?
Hop Pop: (coughing)
Hop Pop: (coughs)
Hop Pop: (croaks)
Hop Pop: (doubtfully) Hmm.
Hop Pop: (exaggerated gasp)
Hop Pop: (exclaims) Oh, hey, Loggle. Just trying to find some glue to put my family shrub together.
Hop Pop: (gargling)
Hop Pop: (gasping) Sylvia! Dance with me instead!
Hop Pop: (gasps)
Hop Pop: (gasps) Frog, help us. A cursed cube possessed by evil magic.
Hop Pop: (gasps) I've been waiting for this day my whole life.
Hop Pop: (gasps) I-it can't be. The music box. It's gone!
Hop Pop: (gasps) It's just as I feared.
Hop Pop: (gasps) Loggle! Help me!
Hop Pop: (gasps) Look! Down there! More zapapedes! They're pretty far down.
Hop Pop: (gasps) My prize-winnin' corn!
Hop Pop: (gasps) Sadie Croaker, the stand's oldest and most loyal customer.
Hop Pop: (gasps) The door is shut. That's not right. (grunts) Hmm. (gasps) The lens is missing!
Hop Pop: (gasps) This house is like family! You apologize!
Hop Pop: (gasps) Why does this keep happening? Now I'll never make it to the cheese museum.
Hop Pop: (groaning)
Hop Pop: (groans)
Hop Pop: (groans) Okay, fine.
Hop Pop: (groans) Well, the important thing is, we're all okay. Except for that Curator. He's dead.
Hop Pop: (grumbles)
Hop Pop: (grunting)
Hop Pop: (grunting) Hold on, kiddo.
Hop Pop: (grunting) Man, what a day.
Hop Pop: (grunts) What the hey?
Hop Pop: (gulps) She's here! I feel like I'm gonna faint. Can frogs faint? I don't know anything anymore!
Hop Pop: (humming) Hmm. Oh, forgot the mustard.
Hop Pop: (inhales) Ah, how I miss the swamp air. The aroma of grass, a whisper of manure, and just a pinch of humidity. Do you feel that humidity, Anne?
Hop Pop: (laughs)
Hop Pop: (laughs) And what about you? I didn't even know you could turn that color. What, you got chameleon in your blood? (laughs)
Hop Pop: (laughs) I was good, wasn't I?
Hop Pop: (laughs) No. Today's the day they announce the Frog of the Year award.
Hop Pop: (laughs) Nope.
Hop Pop: (laughs) That's grubhog's got some sass in him. (chuckles)
Hop Pop: (laughs) You have no idea what I can or can't handle. What do you say, Loggle? Up for another adventure?
Hop Pop: (light chuckle)
Hop Pop: (narrating) "And it was at that moment I realized Bessie was no ordinary snail, but a kind, clear soul who would help others at a drop of a hat. I raised my bid to 400 copper pieces, winning the auction, and in the process, saving Bessie from the nefarious Jim Snapes."
Hop Pop: (narrating) "The leaves had just changed color, and now I shall describe those leaves to you in great detail--" (Anne slams the book shut.)
Hop Pop: (narrating) "The snow swirled around us and I knew we were doomed. I could feel the strength leaving my body bit by bit. The sweet embrace of eternity crept closer and closer. Until suddenly I heard a sound pulling me back." (warbling) "Bessie... Bessie was singing!" (Anne starts sobbing.)
Hop Pop: (offscreen) It's been two hours!
Hop Pop: (offscreen) Well, back in my day we didn't have a bathroom! (Another thud)
Hop Pop: (pushing Anne to the stage) Go on, Anne. Get up there! A Plantar, Frog of the Year. I'm so proud.
Hop Pop: (reading the chair's label) "Massage your tucus the right way with this chair full of rumble bugs. Your life will never be the ding-dang same." (finishes reading the label) Pfft. How good could it be?
Hop Pop: (scoffs) Some mayor. That guy keeps raising our taxes, and what do we got to show for it? Our snail-ways are a mess. Our buildings are falling apart. Heck, we ain't even replaced the schoolhouse after last year's millipede incident!
Hop Pop: (screaming) Stay back! Darned burrow bugs must have chewed the water pipes!
Hop Pop: (screams)
Hop Pop: (screams) A monster bird, ridden by a pile of books! Wait, huh?
Hop Pop: (screams) Glue! Everywhere! Need water!
Hop Pop: (screams) Street freaks! Oh, wait. No, it's just my granddaughter and my adopted granddaughter.
Hop Pop: (screams, grunts) Oh, I bet you're loving this, ain't ya?
Hop Pop: (shocked) Say whaaaaat?
Hop Pop: (sigh) Sprig and Polly's parents.
Hop Pop: (sighs)
Hop Pop: (sighs) I know. No matter how important my ship was, it didn't give me the right to use mind control on you.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Just another job for me to lose.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Mmm. Anne, truth be told, I was never gonna throw you out. I was just talking tough so that you'd show me a little bit more respect.
Hop Pop: (sighs) No. Ever since we lost the vegetable stand I've just felt, well, lost. I was fine the first couple of days, but it's really starting to catch up with me.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Polly's right, guys. It's just too good to pass up.
Hop Pop: (sighs) She was a fierce woman.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Tradition is such a beautiful-- Son of a slug!
Hop Pop: (sighs) Very well. Let's be honest though. Anne'll probably fall asleep and it'll just be me.
Hop Pop: (sighs) Well, after five years of work on this gal, I might actually finish.
Hop Pop: (sighs, mumbles) (gasps) I'm up! I'm awake! The key. It's gone! Oh, no. Did they get out? Is the town rioting? Are they dead? Has Anne eaten the kids, THE WHOLE TOWN? (panting) What's this now? It's still locked.
Hop Pop: (skeptically) Really?
Hop Pop: (slowly) Oh, fine. Didn't get swarmed by killer locusts, if that's what you mean. How was your weekend?
Hop Pop: (snores)
Hop Pop: (snoring)
Hop Pop: (stammers)
Hop Pop: (stammers) Ah, shame the dance is over. I could dance for hours with you.
Hop Pop: (stammers) Huh? (Suddenly being poked on the shoulder and back by a blue frog's hand.) Huh? Ooh!
Hop Pop: (taps off-beat)
Hop Pop: (tea whistling) This is terrible! I never shoulda let you trick me into trying something new!
Hop Pop: (trailing off) I told Charlie Bigbottom to stay out of the...
Hop Pop: (turns around) I really mucked it up this time, kids. (deep breath) I lied to Anne about the music box and I buried it under the tree out front.
Hop Pop: (whimpers)
Hop Pop: (yawns)
Hop Pop: (yawns) Well, that's enough excitement for me today. I think I'm gonna turn in.
Hop Pop: (yawns) Whoa, boy. I needed that. Hope nothing happened while I was asleep to make me mad again. Oh, no. What did you do?
Hop Pop: *screams* We gotta get these reins fixed or we can't control Bessie.
Hop Pop: *sighs* You're right. But when we get there, don't get sucked in by the fancy.
Hop Pop: A bobby pin? And hairbrush, mascara, sunglasses, teen magazine. I think I'm on the right track.
Hop Pop: A pet?
Hop Pop: A scene from The Shallow Pond.
Hop Pop: A trap. So that's what slowed her down.
Hop Pop: Aah! Ow!
Hop Pop: Absolutely not! Look, Anne. You're a new, unsettling, strange, bizarre, gangly, horrifying--
Hop Pop: Absolutely. I've been trying to teach this guy for years. (He points to Sprig.)
Hop Pop: Agreed. And it's nice to see you so passionate about produce, Sprig.
Hop Pop: Ah! Eh, I never liked that guy.
Hop Pop: Ah, I didn't care about that pizza stuff anyway. But you were really trying to help this family out, and that's worth something in my book.
Hop Pop: Ah, Theater night. The one night a month we come together, watch our stories, and forget all our horrible, horrible troubles.
Hop Pop: Ah, a leisurely outing with Bessie. Why, we could really go anywhere. Do anything.
Hop Pop: Ah, good thinking, Sprig.
Hop Pop: Aha! Found it.
Hop Pop: Ahem, may I have this dance, Sylvia Sundew?
Hop Pop: All of you, stop! Yelling at each other ain't fixing any of this.
Hop Pop: All right, B&B it is. But no extras. Hang tight, Bessie. We'll find you a comfy place to rest in a jiffy.
Hop Pop: All right, boy, go get that lucrative business relationship. I mean, romantic relationship. (chuckles) Saved it.
Hop Pop: All right, enough fiddle-faddling. We gotta get home so you guys can finish the season. If I don't talk to someone about it soon, I'm gonna explode! I mean, that part where the island itself is revealed to actually be--
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Get out there and sell like your lives depend on it. Because they do. We-- We really need this.
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Hang on!
Hop Pop: All right, kids. Time for a lunch break.
Hop Pop: All right, you two grubs. Off to bed.
Hop Pop: All righty then! Now, who wants Stumpy's?
Hop Pop: Almost lost my behind to those things.
Hop Pop: Almost there.
Hop Pop: Always gotta make it about you, don't you? "I'm Anne, and my life is worse than everyone else's."
Hop Pop: Always impressive what people are capable of, isn't it? (grunting) A little help, please?
Hop Pop: Amazing. Even in defeat, they're majestic.
Hop Pop: And I was wrong. I know now that you can't work together unless everyone has a say. Jeremy taught me that.
Hop Pop: And how many times did I tell Charlie Bigbottom not to go up the chimney? And that little spider'd look at me with those big green eyes like he understood me. Two minutes later, where do I find him? Up the chimney!
Hop Pop: And look here. This is where the bathroom used to be, behind that bookcase. We just need to break it down!
Hop Pop: And look who's cleaning up after the pet! Hop Pop, that's who!
Hop Pop: And now that you've read this, all you need is experience.
Hop Pop: And over there, I kept a small version of your swimming hole.
Hop Pop: And paranoid. We just need to give 'em time to get used to ya. I think it's best you stay put. (He locks the door.)
Hop Pop: And we're back. But you two gotta promise me you'll go straight to the hotel. No detours!
Hop Pop: And what's wrong with field work? I'll have you know we farmers are the backbone of society! (ribbits)
Hop Pop: And where do you two think you're going?
Hop Pop: And you know the best way to start a quest?
Hop Pop: And you stood by my side.
Hop Pop: Anne can dance?
Hop Pop: Anne!
Hop Pop: Anne! Polly's not budging. She won't even see Sprig till he surrenders. Not only that, but they graffitied my tum-tum. Any luck on your end?
Hop Pop: Anne, I need your help.
Hop Pop: Anne, I told you I was gonna step on that tile.
Hop Pop: Anne, did you just promise to save this restaurant?
Hop Pop: Anne, just ignore it and enjoy your slug gruel. Anne?
Hop Pop: Anne, no. I'll do it. The whole point of this is to get you home alive. I've already had a good life.
Hop Pop: Anne, there's a big difference between courage and stupidity! (screaming)
Hop Pop: Anne, this is based on nothing at all, but I'm almost certain that game will rot your brain! Uh-oh, looks like we're out of glue!
Hop Pop: Anne, wait. Let me at least explain. What I did wasn't right. But I didn't do it to trick ya.
Hop Pop: Anne, wanna chop us some veggies for me?
Hop Pop: Anne, we have to work together.
Hop Pop: Anne, we're gonna go vote for Frog of the Year now. Wanna come?
Hop Pop: Anne, what are you doin' here?
Hop Pop: Anne, when I said earn the town's respect, I didn't mean join a gang.
Hop Pop: Anne, you cannot, by any means, do this.
Hop Pop: Anne, you don't have to do this.
Hop Pop: Anne?
Hop Pop: Anyway, enough dilly-dallying. Chore time! Bessie's waste ain't gonna shovel itself.
Hop Pop: Apologies.
Hop Pop: Aww, well, ain't that nice. Now scooch over. I need a seat.
Hop Pop: Back in my day we called those "character".
Hop Pop: Back in my day we didn't have furniture. We sat on rocks. Sharp ones.
Hop Pop: Back in my day, kids spent less time complainin' and more time watching their step.
Hop Pop: Beautiful. (scream)
Hop Pop: Because this is about more than just me!
Hop Pop: Bessie, things are gettin' messy.
Hop Pop: Boy, I'm tir--
Hop Pop: But just one.
Hop Pop: But now, I'm gonna make things right. I will redeem myself!
Hop Pop: But this door stays open. And no jumping about. Straight to bed.
Hop Pop: But we Plantars have always cooked these recipes. What would my great-gam-gam say?
Hop Pop: But we can't give up so easily.
Hop Pop: But we failed! Uh, I wouldn't recommend touching that.
Hop Pop: Bye, Chuck. Thanks for watching the house, Chuck.
Hop Pop: Can't be yourself without your signature hat.
Hop Pop: Can't dance, huh? We'll see about that. Looks easy enough. Sorry, Sylvia. And a-one, and a-two and--
Hop Pop: Can't say I agree, but you do your thing.
Hop Pop: Can't wait to feel those bubbles in my pants.
Hop Pop: Captain Grime?
Hop Pop: Careful, It spits acid.
Hop Pop: Careful, boy! It could be hungry.
Hop Pop: Come on, Anne. You've been here long enough.
Hop Pop: Come on, Bessie. Come on.
Hop Pop: Come on, boy. I want to get my adventure on!
Hop Pop: Come on, gang. Let's get this merger back on track.
Hop Pop: Come on, kids, throw some dirt on it! Get some water!
Hop Pop: Come on, kids. Give Anne and her friend a chance to catch up.
Hop Pop: Cool, yes. But they can be a rough sort. It's probably for the best that we all stay clear of--Oh, dang it. There they go.
Hop Pop: Corrupt its sacred message.
Hop Pop: Dang it, Anne, how much did you spend?
Hop Pop: Dang it, Polly. You're getting filth everywhere! (A crash is heard.)
Hop Pop: Dang it, kids! What have I told you about roughhousing near the windows? Now, come inside and play a quiet game. Hop Pop's working.
Hop Pop: Dang shallow pockets. Well, you get what you pay for.
Hop Pop: Did any of those frog skins look like my friend Gabe? I haven't seen him in a while.
Hop Pop: Did you girls mistake me for a corpse?!
Hop Pop: Don't be ridiculous. Basement ghosts don't sound anything like that.
Hop Pop: Don't call me HP. (clears throat) It's half a day's travel, but that should be no trouble for this gang.
Hop Pop: Don't care. You can't drive Bessie, unless you read this cover to cover. And that's final.
Hop Pop: Don't do anything stupid! (He slams the door.)
Hop Pop: Don't have to be blood to be a Plantar, Anne.
Hop Pop: Don't stare into the abyss, Anne. After all, it stares back. You got that costume on yet, boy?
Hop Pop: Don't tempt me!
Hop Pop: Don't worry about the crowds, Anne. I have a pla-Anne.
Hop Pop: Don't worry. Good thing I brought my copper matches.
Hop Pop: Don't you see, kids? If I win this election, I'll prove once and for all that Hopediah Plantar ain't no loser!
Hop Pop: Double no.
Hop Pop: Eh, I try not to.
Hop Pop: Eh, I'm sure by morning clearer heads will prevail.
Hop Pop: Eh, he'll be fine. (He uses the flag as a parachute.) Whee!
Hop Pop: Eh, no. (grunting) Oh. No. I-- It was me!
Hop Pop: Eh, they're a militarized culture, Sprig. I'm not surprised they don't know how to let loose.
Hop Pop: Eh.
Hop Pop: Eh? Found them? Kids, I wasn't being literal.
Hop Pop: Election?
Hop Pop: Enough chatter, you three. Time to hit the books.
Hop Pop: Ever since the end of that last episode, I-I couldn't sleep. I fell in love with those crazy kids on their crazy island. I couldn't get enough! I did the only thing I could.
Hop Pop: Everyone! Come on, get off the roof, quick!
Hop Pop: Exactly. Less mobility means less trouble.
Hop Pop: Excuse me, pardon me.
Hop Pop: Excuse me?
Hop Pop: Fair enough, Anne. How do we bring this thing back to life? Magic? Live sacrifice? I know a guy in town--
Hop Pop: Fair point.
Hop Pop: Fame changes people, kids. And not in a good way.
Hop Pop: Few days, huh? Well, I hate to say it, but we really need to get back to Wartwood. The harvest is coming up and we can't miss it.
Hop Pop: Finally, the luxury I deserve.
Hop Pop: Finally. Let's go. Hyah! Hyah!
Hop Pop: Fine. Play your newfangled games. But it's that attitude that's causing tradition to be left in the dust... (coughs, sighs) Guess what, Sal? It's your old pal Hop... (gasps) What the... Wha... What happened here?! Sal? Sal?! (strains) Sal's trademark fedora. But he never went anywhere without it. (thinking) Sal would never leave his shop unattended. Something happened here, something bad.
Hop Pop: First class!
Hop Pop: Fly, you fools.
Hop Pop: For goodness' sakes, Anne, put that lamp out. We're trying to catch the thief, not scare it away. Anne: (blows) (yawns)
Hop Pop: For two coppers or less.
Hop Pop: Forget it. We ain't spending coppers on lodging when we've got a perfectly fine tent--
Hop Pop: Friends and frog folk, step right up. New limited edition Plantar's Potion. Only 20 coppers a bottle!
Hop Pop: Get my hands on those books.
Hop Pop: Get outta here!
Hop Pop: Get your hands off my cookies.
Hop Pop: Give me a break.
Hop Pop: Gladly. And a-one and a-two--(screams)
Hop Pop: Go grab a weapon or three, dear. These temples have been pretty nasty, and I wanna be ready for anything.
Hop Pop: Go, Anne!
Hop Pop: Good idea.
Hop Pop: Good idea. She can carry more crab legs.
Hop Pop: Good! (snoring)
Hop Pop: Good, good. Great to know we definitely didn't have two wacky adventures.
Hop Pop: Got it covered! Believe it or not, I made each of you your very own suit of armor.
Hop Pop: Got yer last frog. Whoo! You lose. Oh, yeah!
Hop Pop: Great grubs, Sprig! Your feet are cold!
Hop Pop: Great idea, Mrs. Croaker.
Hop Pop: Great suggestion, Anne.
Hop Pop: Guess we were wrong to doubt you, Anne. You really are used to extreme camping.
Hop Pop: Guess what, kids!
Hop Pop: Ha! Got it! (laughs) Anne, you did it!
Hop Pop: Ha! You'll see.
Hop Pop: Hang in there, Anne!
Hop Pop: Hated it? Hated it?! I LOVED it!
Hop Pop: Have someone else do your comedy, Anne! I can't go back out there!
Hop Pop: He'll also make us rich. We'd be set for life.
Hop Pop: Heh heh heh. (inhales) Yeah. I probably was a little bit too harsh. But I only did it because you remind me of myself when I was your age. Rough around the edges. Now, put that bag down, young lady. You're not going anywhere.
Hop Pop: Heh! How can I even choose? Jumpin' out in front of Bessie and overturnin' the wagon. Gettin' tarantula hair everywhere. Then there was the time he put a hole in the roof.
Hop Pop: Heh! Me? In case you forgot, I despise that garbage.
Hop Pop: Help!
Hop Pop: Here we are!
Hop Pop: Here we go.
Hop Pop: Here you go, sir. I hope you'll give Plantar's another chance, someday.
Hop Pop: Here, Anne. How 'bout you put these turnips "all in" our display?
Hop Pop: Hey now! Come on you two! Let's at least try to get along.
Hop Pop: Hey!
Hop Pop: Hey! (laughing) Come and get it.
Hop Pop: Hey! Ain't this what you want?
Hop Pop: Hey! Hey! I said look away from the fancy.
Hop Pop: Hey, everyone. Lookie. I've got Anne's shoe.
Hop Pop: Hey, kids.
Hop Pop: Hey, kids. What'd y'all get for tonight's Shut-In? Show me the goods.
Hop Pop: Hey, um, think we could keep this just between us?
Hop Pop: Hey, you make fun of me all you want, but you leave him out of this.
Hop Pop: Hey. None of that. Kids, when one of your own makes it big, you support them. No matter what. Because deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down, they're the same person.
Hop Pop: Historically frogs, toads, and newts haven't really gotten-
Hop Pop: Hmm! I got this.
Hop Pop: Hmm.
Hop Pop: Hmm. (sniffs) Hmm. Hmm! Nope. Never seen anything like it.
Hop Pop: Hmm. Got any threes?
Hop Pop: Hmm. Hey, Marcy, what does this say?
Hop Pop: Hmm. If there was only some clue as to which way she went--
Hop Pop: Hmm. Intriguing. Yet another choice. Looks like my day just got a lot more challenging.
Hop Pop: Hmm. Where are those dang kids?
Hop Pop: Hmm...
Hop Pop: Hmph.
Hop Pop: Hmph. (croaks)
Hop Pop: Hmph. For now.
Hop Pop: Hold on, gang. Look!
Hop Pop: Hold on, you kids. Hold on.
Hop Pop: Hold up! From what I've heard, that bazaar is full of greedy degenerates. Wave that thing around, and it'll get stolen for sure. Tell you what. I'll reach out to some frogs I knoW and see if they know a thing about your music chest.
Hop Pop: Holy smokes!
Hop Pop: Holy smokes! Acid!
Hop Pop: Holy smokes. That's a lot of percents.
Hop Pop: How 'bout it, Carl?
Hop Pop: How are those kids supposed to make up if they won't even see one another?
Hop Pop: How the heck did this get on her tail, though?
Hop Pop: How was I supposed to know the rest of the valley got a vote? I'm a theater major, for cricket's sake!
Hop Pop: Hugging a little tight there, Anne.
Hop Pop: Huh, I thought Briar and Iris Bogwater ran this place.
Hop Pop: Huh.
Hop Pop: Huh. So, what do you kids want for dinner? I was thinking ravioli.
Hop Pop: Huh?
Hop Pop: Huh? (screams)
Hop Pop: Huh? Wha-- What's goin' on?
Hop Pop: Hush, Polly. Think those thoughts, don't say them.
Hop Pop: Hush. I promised myself if I ever made it to Newtopia, I'd swing by for one of those sweet, sweet sandies. Now, come on, gang, who's ready to revisit the glory days?
Hop Pop: Hyah!
Hop Pop: I can dance better than you. I've been trained by the best, and I'm gonna take you down!
Hop Pop: I can't believe we're actually here. No Plantar has ever gone to Newtopia University. And it's my dream that one day, far, far from now, one of you two will attend.
Hop Pop: I can't lie anymore! I buried the box here. And now it's missing!
Hop Pop: I can't watch.
Hop Pop: I care about you too, Anne.
Hop Pop: I do like pancakes.
Hop Pop: I do.
Hop Pop: I don't even know what that means!
Hop Pop: I don't feel safe.
Hop Pop: I don't get it. Why?
Hop Pop: I don't know. Bein' friends is one thing, but roommates? Ya think ya know someone until they're in your space and you're in theirs, and ya can't stand how they whistle all the time, and they complain whenever ya clean your web crusties out. (yelling) "Yes, I have to do it in our room! It has the best lighting!" (back to normal) My point is-- (He sees that Anne and Sprig have already left.) And they're gone. Mark my words though. No good will come of this. No good at all. (He sinks into the water.)
Hop Pop: I don't understand, Anne. I thought you forgave me.
Hop Pop: I have a lot of green friends who would find that offensive.
Hop Pop: I knew it! You two always... (starts crying) ...disobeying and causing trouble!
Hop Pop: I know that was hard for you, Anne. Thank you, you know, for everything.
Hop Pop: I know what it's like to miss something, Anne. I find myself pining after the good old days way too much.
Hop Pop: I love it. Just a hard-boiled guy tryin' to right wrongs, without any of that fancy color nonsense getting in the way.
Hop Pop: I may have lost the race, but I'm back at the market with all of you. And that makes me a winner. This is perfect. I wouldn't have put the root vegetables with the tubers, though. It's not important. (beat) I'll fix it later.
Hop Pop: I may have lost, but I stood my ground and fought for something important. And that feels good.
Hop Pop: I mean, look, Sprig, she's clearly harmless.
Hop Pop: I need you to know why I hid the music box. It's dangerous. I was just trying to protect the family.
Hop Pop: I put way too much on your shoulders. I should've just let you have fun at the fair.
Hop Pop: I seen things.
Hop Pop: I snuck out to the livin' room to watch another episode.
Hop Pop: I suppose that'd be all right.
Hop Pop: I sure did. (chuckles) Amazing what you can get for two coppers these days.
Hop Pop: I think that's everyone.
Hop Pop: I thought we were goners.
Hop Pop: I thought you kids deserved a treat after, well...
Hop Pop: I understand that, Anne. But that Curator guy is... Well, just look at him!
Hop Pop: I vowed only to watch one, but Suspicion Island had its hooks in me! And before I realized what had happened, I'd finished the season!
Hop Pop: I'll get it!
Hop Pop: I'm a crisp 68!
Hop Pop: I'm good.
Hop Pop: I'm not that old. But, yes, thank you.
Hop Pop: I'm okay!
Hop Pop: I'm so happy I lived to see this.
Hop Pop: I'm sorry, Anne. You take all the time you need. Maybe it's enough to admit we still got issues, instead of pretending they don't exist.
Hop Pop: I've heard talk of a creature called the zapapede that lives deep in the Misty Peaks. It zaps its prey with a small spark of lightnin'. Yeah, it's pretty cool, actually.
Hop Pop: I-I-I made the batter from scratch, you know. Uh, been up since the crack of dawn, mixing.
Hop Pop: IS SOMEONE DEAD?!!!
Hop Pop: If I just had been there... I know things would've been different! Ever since then, I swore I'd never let my family down again. That I'd do anything to protect them. So when I found out the box was dangerous, I lied to you and hid it away. I thought I was protecting my family. But now I realize how foolish it was. You're my family too. And I've let you down. I let us all down. (starts breaking down in tears) I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm just so sorry!
Hop Pop: If I lose on purpose, Toadstool will give us the stand back.
Hop Pop: Impressive. Kinda scary. But impressive.
Hop Pop: Impressive. They say King Andrias is one of the best flipwart players around.
Hop Pop: Improv? I've never done that before.
Hop Pop: Isn't that what I said?
Hop Pop: Isn't this exciting? You'll have to miss the fair, of course, but it's for a good cause. Come on, boy. Do it for the family. What do you say?
Hop Pop: It begins.
Hop Pop: It burns! It burns!
Hop Pop: It don't count if ya don't have to pay for it.
Hop Pop: It is true that you fell out of the sky.
Hop Pop: It must be immune to magic.
Hop Pop: It was a few years ago. I was on a journey when the herons attacked Wartwood. Sprig and Polly survived. But their parents... weren't so lucky.
Hop Pop: It's an expression, Anne. What are you, the fact police?
Hop Pop: It's gonna be dangerous. Perilous even.
Hop Pop: It's not a "toy boat," Anne. It's a replica of a famous warship.
Hop Pop: It's some kind of love monsoon.
Hop Pop: It's true.
Hop Pop: Just a little dehydrated from the heat. We'll be alright.
Hop Pop: Just about. We gotta sell to one more sucker and we'll be home free.
Hop Pop: Just farm frogs? Kids, the point of the shrub is to give you an appreciation for your past. The Plantar family has layers. You just have to know where to look.
Hop Pop: Just one, please. We'll all pile in.
Hop Pop: Just remember to do the same when I'm rich and famous.
Hop Pop: Just tell me and I'll do it. Anything!
Hop Pop: Kids!
Hop Pop: Kids! Chow time! (In the kitchen, Hop Pop is serving a meal. Anne and Sprig bang their fists on the table while Polly flaps her arms.)
Hop Pop: Kids, I messed up big. I was so desperate to save the stand, I forgot what the stand was even about.
Hop Pop: Kids, get your butts over here!
Hop Pop: Kids, melt the rest of 'em, quick!
Hop Pop: Kids, no! Stop fightin'!
Hop Pop: Kids, no! Stop fighting!
Hop Pop: Kids, stop pushing. Ow!
Hop Pop: Lemme go! The couch is the only one who understands me!
Hop Pop: Let me go. Let me go!
Hop Pop: Let's get outta here.
Hop Pop: Let's see. (He opens his wallet.) Nothing. All we can afford is window-shopping, kids.
Hop Pop: Like I said, I already paid my dang taxes. You can't come in here, and that's final.
Hop Pop: Like I said, even.
Hop Pop: Like we agreed, you'll get Sprig to work at your restaurant, and I'll get the seeds to those Sundew vegetables.
Hop Pop: Little help here?
Hop Pop: Look Anne, we've got a few days to kill before King Andrias reveals his findings about the music box. And what better way to spend that time than learning? (Anne, Sprig, and Polly groan. Anne then sees various food outside.)
Hop Pop: Look after Joe Sparrow, Frobo. We'll be back soon.
Hop Pop: Look, I'm sure we can find a way to bury this so no one finds out.
Hop Pop: Look. I'm sorry, okay? But I have to go to the Annual Crop Convention. It's a long ways away, and I can't leave you kids on the farm alone for the weekend.
Hop Pop: Looks like I owe you an apology. I knew you were my good girl. And you know? Maybe it was all too much to put on your shoulders. Tell you what. After today, you'll never have to look after Micro-Angelo again. How's that... sound?
Hop Pop: Looks like it's hopeless.
Hop Pop: Love doves. Don't move or we're dead.
Hop Pop: Make way! Plague towels, everyone. Plague towels.
Hop Pop: Mama's old gourd tea recipe. I'm not surprised you don't like the smell. It's way too strong for you.
Hop Pop: May I?
Hop Pop: Maybe a little.
Hop Pop: Maybe we need a mayor who looks out for the people he's mayoring. 'Cause ours, well...(chuckles) He's only looking out for himself. Anyway, good afternoon, everybody.
Hop Pop: Me too.
Hop Pop: Me? Well, to be honest, my cholesterol's been a little...
Hop Pop: Mighty impressive.
Hop Pop: Mind the flagstone.
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm.
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm. Sure. Anyway, since we only have a couple of days left in the city, I figured we could spend the afternoon shopping for souvenirs. Now get out there and buy anything you'd like!
Hop Pop: Mm-hmm...I hope you like pancakes.
Hop Pop: Morning, kids! Time to start the chores. Whoa! Is that a blue moon shell? (gasps) Beautiful! You know, some frogs die never having seen one.
Hop Pop: Morning, kids. Ready for the brisk open waters? Ahoy, there.
Hop Pop: Must be painful to make so little sense all the time.
Hop Pop: My baby! Whew! That was close.
Hop Pop: My fault? It's obviously yours.
Hop Pop: My, my, so many glues to choose from. (humming) This is gonna be a little difficult.
Hop Pop: Next time, we'll include you, Anne, even if we know you'll hate it.
Hop Pop: No buts. Now I'm gonna go into my study to get a little reading done.
Hop Pop: No fun till the shrub's done. Just gonna run to the store real quick and get more glue. Be back in a jiffy. (hums) Don't go anywhere!
Hop Pop: No pets! Every time we get one, Sprig and Polly swear they're gonna take care of it! Like this one spider we had, Charlie Bigbottom. I mean, sure, they were there for all the cuddlin' and the snugglin', but who gets stuck doin' all the work? Good ol' Hop Pop, that's who! I swear to Frog, whoever brings a fuzzy critter into this house will be on dung duty for a month!
Hop Pop: No! (Slaps the potion out of Mrs. Croaker's hand.)
Hop Pop: No! Get your hands off me!
Hop Pop: No! Well, yes, but... it's complicated!
Hop Pop: No, I insist.
Hop Pop: No, no! I-it's not like that. I-it's just...I've lost so much already and--
Hop Pop: No, silly. It's a traditional recipe from my family's cookbook. We been using this baby since I was a pollywog.
Hop Pop: No, you stay up there where it's safe.
Hop Pop: No? Well, then how about a pity early bedtime?
Hop Pop: None taken.
Hop Pop: Nope! I'm running for mayor.
Hop Pop: Nope. Sorry, Gary.
Hop Pop: Not a chance.
Hop Pop: Not before reading this, you ain't.
Hop Pop: Not especially.
Hop Pop: Not helping, Polly.
Hop Pop: Not really. I know I've been doing well, but if I mess up tomorrow, it could cost us the election.
Hop Pop: Not right away. Love doves prefer to let their prey marinate in fear first.
Hop Pop: Not right, yeah, sure. Here, Sprig, load up on crab legs. These babies go fast.
Hop Pop: Not so fast, kids!
Hop Pop: Not to mention she's a tad overconfident.
Hop Pop: Not without a diversion, we won't. Anne. Give me your shoe.
Hop Pop: Nothing like a nap to feel rejuvenated and full of energy.
Hop Pop: Now come on. I'll make y'all some mushroom soup.
Hop Pop: Now sit your butt down and put on your cheese hat. (He puts a cheese hat on Sprig.)
Hop Pop: Now that that's settled, I wrote a long list of comebacks to get you back for this morning. (clears throat) "Hey, Anne, is that your hair, or is it a dandelion?" Ha. (sniffles) Uh-- Oh. Are those long, lanky limbs, Anne, or are those, uh, twigs? Ah! (chuckles) Eh...
Hop Pop: Now that you mention it.
Hop Pop: Now then, Bessie, you remember Micro-Angelo? The cute little snail we bought in Newtopia? Well, I'm sure you've noticed that he is young and cute and needs to be protected at all costs.
Hop Pop: Now what?
Hop Pop: Now who wants popcorn?
Hop Pop: Now, I suppose, if I'm honest, I do feel somewhat of a rush.
Hop Pop: Now, I'm right here if you need me.
Hop Pop: Now, hold on. Instead of that garbage, how 'bout I treat you to some real entertainment?
Hop Pop: Now, hold on. That's unfair.
Hop Pop: Now, now, hold on. Before we get carried away, what about this tried-and-true recipe? Swamp mold pot pie!
Hop Pop: Now, remember, gang. The mountain pass will clear up in one week. Meaning, it's almost time to leave this valley and find Anne a way home.
Hop Pop: Now, see here. You got your shooters-- That's you and Croaker-- And you got your passers, me and Chuck. That's Chuck, by the way.
Hop Pop: Nuh-uh. Kids, souvenirs are only meaningful if you pay for them yourself.
Hop Pop: Nyeh! Dang it, Sprig!
Hop Pop: Of course, my sweet baby child. Okay, here we go! Come on, kids!
Hop Pop: Oh right.
Hop Pop: Oh!
Hop Pop: Oh! (sighs) Everyone okay?
Hop Pop: Oh! Pill bugs are on sale.
Hop Pop: Oh, Anne, I love the spa. Did you get that fishy pedicure?
Hop Pop: Oh, Anne, uh, whoops, I, uh--
Hop Pop: Oh, I agree. You know they're actually eating the dead skin off the bottom of your feet?
Hop Pop: Oh, I'm furious about the cane. You're on dish duty for a month!
Hop Pop: Oh, absolutely.
Hop Pop: Oh, and best of all, no more pit of fire.
Hop Pop: Oh, and look after Polly you two.
Hop Pop: Oh, and you can't forget second cousin Alfred. He was the king!
Hop Pop: Oh, come on, gang. We'll never get Anne home if we get bitten to death by a venomous snake fly.
Hop Pop: Oh, dang it! The ding-dang reins snapped.
Hop Pop: Oh, dang it! You know what? I'm gonna take a nap. I don't believe this. I feed you, I house you, and this is how you repay me? If you don't shape up soon, Anne, I'm throwin' you out! (He slams his bedroom door and a flower vase falls down.)
Hop Pop: Oh, dang it, Sprig. Well, looks like this meal's a bust. Who wants to eat out?
Hop Pop: Oh, frog! I'm unemployed!
Hop Pop: Oh, ha-ha.
Hop Pop: Oh, he'll be fine. But now, someone has to take care of the grubhog, and I volunteered you, Sprig.
Hop Pop: Oh, heya, kids. Yoo-hoo! Eh, just packing a small souvenir, uh, then we can head out.
Hop Pop: Oh, mighty kind of ya.
Hop Pop: Oh, my frog!
Hop Pop: Oh, no, no, no. A-After you, my dear.
Hop Pop: Oh, no, ya don't! This here's river water. No tellin' what creepy critters are swimmin' around. (A river lamprey reveals its eyes above water and then swims again.)
Hop Pop: Oh, no, you don't. Not by yourself.
Hop Pop: Oh, shoot. Snail trouble, everyone. Snail trouble.
Hop Pop: Oh, so not from around these parts?
Hop Pop: Oh, sweet relief!
Hop Pop: Oh, that's just the way these frogs are. Slow to accept, and even slower to respect. It's actually our town motto. You'll find a way to get their respect, in your own weird Anne way. Now, who wants pill bug pancakes?
Hop Pop: Oh, that's just the way we are, Anne. You should have seen last year's avocados versus almonds fiasco. We almost tore this place to the ground.
Hop Pop: Oh, uh, eh, so where do I sit?
Hop Pop: Oh, uh...(sighs) I better not.
Hop Pop: Oh, we'll see about that, Monroe. We'll see. (whistle blowing) Huh?
Hop Pop: Oh, well, that sounds nice.
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah, I got lots of vegetables back home.
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah? Well, at least my hair isn't rainbow stardust.
Hop Pop: Oh, yeah? Well, you... I...
Hop Pop: Oh.
Hop Pop: Oh. False alarm, everyone. Just a human thing.
Hop Pop: Oh. I like the cut of your jib, Mr. Tray-tony. Did I say that right?
Hop Pop: Ohhh!
Hop Pop: Okay! Fine!
Hop Pop: Okay, boy. Here's the plan. First, I'll go in with a distraction. Then you come in behind...
Hop Pop: Okay, enough prattle. We gotta get a move on before we're locked in here.
Hop Pop: Okay, fine. I used the credit card! I'm so ashamed. But if you could just feel this thing, kids. It's heaven on your rump. Nirvana on your tush. Bliss on your buttocks.
Hop Pop: Okay, kiddo. See ya outside.
Hop Pop: Okay, kids, I'll be back in the morning for our meeting with the king. You enjoy yourselves. I'm off to spend a little much needed me time. And by me time, I mean a full body...
Hop Pop: Okay, kids. That's enough flirting with death. Let's head home.
Hop Pop: Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Hop Pop: Okay, then. (The Plantars leave.)
Hop Pop: Okay, you're right. I told you so. (chuckles) Still gonna be a few weeks before that snowpack melts.
Hop Pop: Okay.
Hop Pop: Okay. But don't dally too long, Anne.
Hop Pop: One of the rare things life where you actually get out what you put in! It's beautiful! (laughs as he and Marcy head to the store)
Hop Pop: Ooh, I get a scepter.
Hop Pop: Ooh. They won!
Hop Pop: Or crushed to death by a sand liger.
Hop Pop: Or eaten to death by a camouflaged sod skink.
Hop Pop: Or heck, cleaning products.
Hop Pop: Or, you know, not.
Hop Pop: Our hands are tied, literally.
Hop Pop: Out of the way, kids!
Hop Pop: Overrated, eh? How's diving into adventure been working out so far?
Hop Pop: Ow!
Hop Pop: Ow.
Hop Pop: Play the forbidden note.
Hop Pop: Please, Anne. Just let me explain.
Hop Pop: Point is, the frogs in this town can be pretty small-minded.
Hop Pop: Polli Anna? Oh, brace yourselves. She wasn't just any farmer. She was a turnip farmer!
Hop Pop: Polly and Sprig are the ringleaders. If we can just get them to get along, we'll be fine.
Hop Pop: Polly's a baby, Anne.
Hop Pop: Polly, don't throw that. Throw this potato instead.
Hop Pop: Polly, let's go spread the good news. The Plantars are back, baby! And just remember. The family name is in your hands.
Hop Pop: Promise.
Hop Pop: Quick, kids, bow. (grunts)
Hop Pop: Quiet, boy. Look! There's one now! A zapapede!
Hop Pop: Really? Aw, kids. I won't let you down. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom practicing my distinguished expression! (laughs)
Hop Pop: Research!
Hop Pop: Ribbiton? As in Ribbiton's Ribbons? The finest web crusty floss in all of Amphibia?
Hop Pop: Ribbitvale? The most expensive town in all Amphibia? No way!
Hop Pop: Right--It's right there!
Hop Pop: Rise and shine, sleepyheads! Ya missed breakfast!
Hop Pop: Run, kids!
Hop Pop: Sadness. The world is sadness. But look. There. A pond! Is it deep? Or shallow?
Hop Pop: Safe travels, brother.
Hop Pop: Say what?
Hop Pop: Say what?! But why?
Hop Pop: Secret rooms? Full of Plantar family heirlooms? Why, this is incredible! And most importantly, once again, I was right.
Hop Pop: Seriously, Anne, no need to torture yourself. Take Bessie and go home. And don't you worry about us, 'cause we'll be just fine without you.
Hop Pop: Servants?
Hop Pop: She don't need your respect.
Hop Pop: She has a point.
Hop Pop: She lives in my basement.
Hop Pop: She may be gigantic, but she's also a child.
Hop Pop: She seems friendly... ish.
Hop Pop: Sheesh. Dramatic much? Now if you'll excuse me, Polly's due for a wash. (He picks up a dirty Polly from a mud puddle.)
Hop Pop: Shh! Let's watch our little love doves fly. Love doves are birds that mate for life.
Hop Pop: Shh! No, no, no. Polly, don't!
Hop Pop: Shh. These monsters respond to sound. Let's back away slowly and quietly.
Hop Pop: Shush, youngsters. Have a little respect. This is Sal's. Sal was like a brother to me. We've been friends since the old ways were just "the ways." He was so good at making sandwiches, he decided to relocate to Newtopia to make the "buko dolares." Oh, kids, how I've dreamed of those sandwiches. That lightly toasted bread, the fresh green lettuce, the thin yet supple slices of roast beetle, and finally... the sauce. Tangy, zippy, and just plain amazing. Oh, lordy!!
Hop Pop: Slick. Here we go. Look out. Ha!
Hop Pop: So roommate thing didn't work out, huh?
Hop Pop: So there's nothing I can do to fix this? Not one thing?
Hop Pop: So, table for three.
Hop Pop: So...this mean we can't have your table?
Hop Pop: Something ain't right. She's not spitting at full force. Almost as if she's ashamed.
Hop Pop: Sorry, Anne, but nobody's hiding anywhere today. I need help at the vegetable stand. We got a bumper crop of scream beans that need sellin'.
Hop Pop: Sorry, Sprig, but after the Ruins of Disaster incident, you've left me no choice.
Hop Pop: Sorry, kiddo. But you're just too young for that. But you can have as many cookies as you want.
Hop Pop: Sorry, we're just-- Carry on. (closes the door)
Hop Pop: Sorry.
Hop Pop: Spoke too soon?
Hop Pop: Sprig Plantar! Under no circumstances are you to take that card outside of this hotel!
Hop Pop: Sprig sure looks tired, doesn't he? Awfully suspicious. And don't call me HP.
Hop Pop: Sprig! Polly!
Hop Pop: Sprig, I don't understand. I-I thought you said fixing the family name was important to you.
Hop Pop: Sprig, I owe you an apology.
Hop Pop: Sprig, behave yourself.
Hop Pop: Sprig, bring that lantern over here. Polly, get under there and take a look.
Hop Pop: Sprig, just let Polly win this one, before things get even worse.
Hop Pop: Sprig, next time we won't get the courtship kit out until you're good and ready. Now I can focus on finding love for Polly.
Hop Pop: Step lightly, everyone. This thing doesn't look like it can take much weight.
Hop Pop: Still can't believe I traded my favorite dentures for that map.
Hop Pop: Such wisdom. (Anne and Polly sigh.)
Hop Pop: Sure.
Hop Pop: Sylvia, I don't think I'll ever be able to tell you how I feel about you. But I can show you. Hit it, boys!
Hop Pop: Ta-da!
Hop Pop: Take her to go!
Hop Pop: Teakettle beam, fire!
Hop Pop: Technically, yes.
Hop Pop: Tell you what, let's sleep on it, come back in the morning, and see if we can get some answers, okay?
Hop Pop: Ten shows nightly. They can't get enough. Sprig, this puppet show is a great idea. You redeemed the family name after all. I'm proud of you. Both of you. That whole killing-the-grubhog stuff has always been pretty severe.
Hop Pop: Thank goodness.
Hop Pop: Thank you for your patronage.
Hop Pop: Thank you, Jeremy. Hmm. Nope. Hmm. Nope. Hmm. This one's a maybe.
Hop Pop: Thank you.
Hop Pop: Thanks for showing me the way, Jeremy.
Hop Pop: Thanks, Sadie. I'll work hard to earn your trust back.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. (sighs) Guess I've got some thinking to do.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. For the apology, not the ticket.
Hop Pop: Thanks, kids. Let's just get home and relax a little. You know, maybe the end of one tradition means the start of another. Maybe I ought to start over the Hop Pop way, experiment with those new seed varieties I always wanted to try.
Hop Pop: Thanks. But we only need three. Polly here'll be bunking with me.
Hop Pop: That "boring stuff" is called literature, Anne. And maybe, if you had an ounce of culture, you wouldn't reject it in favor of your substandard, puerile garbage show!
Hop Pop: That is preposterous!
Hop Pop: That reference means nothing to me.
Hop Pop: That was no health potion! It's garbage! (His voice echoes.) Folks, I'm so sorry. I never meant any harm. All I was trying to do was save my stand.
Hop Pop: That's 'cause everyone in your world is crazy. Now, where was I? Oh, yes, Great Aunt Gertrude. She was a masterful dirt tiller. I mean, how cool is that?
Hop Pop: That's a Coastal Kill-a-pillar! They're dangerous amphibivores, and they only get white spots right before they're about to--
Hop Pop: That's a bunch of malarkey! My eyesight's fine! (pauses) Who's that, Sprig? Anyway, don't you have chores to do?
Hop Pop: That's all well and good, but can you at least use the front door?
Hop Pop: That's good enough for me!
Hop Pop: That's it!
Hop Pop: That's my Sprig! I knew I could count on you. This guy, everyone! This guy!
Hop Pop: That's my little spitter.
Hop Pop: That's right, Anne. I watched all the episodes. Every single one!
Hop Pop: That's what older brothers do, Sprig. They look out for their little sisters. Now, move that rump over to that stump.
Hop Pop: That's why I'm begging you. Teach me your ways! I can't tell Sylvia how I feel, but maybe I can show her by dancing with her.
Hop Pop: That's, uh...hard to say no to.
Hop Pop: That, too.
Hop Pop: The annual village potluck. Every year we frogs gather for a great contest. The family who brings the best-tasting dish is showered with love and copper coins. The family with the worst-tasting dish spends the night in... (thunderclap)
Hop Pop: The corn thief! And it's the scariest thing I've ever seen!
Hop Pop: The door to this place is set on a sunlight timer. It opens when the sun rises and deadlocks when the sun sets.
Hop Pop: The girls told me everything, Sprig.
Hop Pop: The moment has passed, hasn't it?
Hop Pop: The only disgrace is you as mayor.
Hop Pop: The plan is to win.
Hop Pop: Then let's do this!
Hop Pop: Then this courtship will be ruined! Along with my financial security!
Hop Pop: There are diagrams.
Hop Pop: There were no contacts! I read the box was dangerous. I didn't know what to do! I panicked! You gotta understand. I was just trying to protect Sprig and Polly!
Hop Pop: There's a reason for that. They're in the "dangerous vegetables" section. It suggests we go for prunes instead. Can't go wrong with prunes!
Hop Pop: They tried to eat us.
Hop Pop: They're real!
Hop Pop: This book has been in our family for as long as I can remember. And look.
Hop Pop: This can't be good.
Hop Pop: This is Bessie's History. Before touching a snail's reins, you gotta know them. Feel their heartbeat next to yours and become one.
Hop Pop: This is a big deal. The last Plantar to do it botched the job so bad, we shunned him for life.
Hop Pop: This place is magnificent.
Hop Pop: This way. Let's move.
Hop Pop: Those capes sure are flammable.
Hop Pop: Time will tell, Anne. Time will tell. Say, you got any of that lippy balm? Lips are feeling pretty dry.
Hop Pop: To the max!
Hop Pop: Toads from Toad Tower. They rule over the entire valley.
Hop Pop: Too bad they couldn't--(gasps)
Hop Pop: Tut-tut. Sprig, give Polly the seat.
Hop Pop: Uh, I'm not quite sure myself, Anne. But never mind that. Great news! Ralphie Underbrook has the plague!
Hop Pop: Uh, boy, what are you doin'?
Hop Pop: Uh, right, the music box. No problem. My contacts will have it ready by tomorrow.
Hop Pop: Uh, wai-- Wha-- None of that was real? But it was so terrifying!
Hop Pop: Uh-huh.
Hop Pop: Uh-oh.
Hop Pop: Uh... What?
Hop Pop: Uh... we're all sold out.
Hop Pop: Understand? Understand! I miss Charlie Bigbottom with all my heart and soul!
Hop Pop: Us too.
Hop Pop: Wait, Polly! Don't actually hit anyone!
Hop Pop: Wait, how could they be both grounded and supernatural?
Hop Pop: Wait, what?
Hop Pop: Wait. "Baby precious"? That's a pet name, for a pet! You sneak a pet in here?
Hop Pop: Wait. A black caterpillar with white spots?
Hop Pop: Walk it off, boy. Yes, hi, nice to meet ya. Now, can someone please tell me why there's a toad army invading Wartwood?!
Hop Pop: Watch out! (He bumps into Anne.)
Hop Pop: Watch where you're pointin' that finger!
Hop Pop: Way to go, Frobo!
Hop Pop: We came as fast as we could.
Hop Pop: We depart for the final temple tomorrow, Bessie, ol' gal, and I have a big job for ya. Speak of the frog devil. Polly, leave Micro-Angelo here with us and get back to packin'.
Hop Pop: We go make things right. That's the Plantar way.
Hop Pop: We got you, Anne. No matter what.
Hop Pop: We gotta find Bessie.
Hop Pop: We have to quarantine her!
Hop Pop: We know. Polly set us straight.
Hop Pop: We'll see.
Hop Pop: We're in. I can't wait for some authentic swamp cooking!
Hop Pop: We're just saying there's an extremely high possibility of that, yes.
Hop Pop: Well I want to see these rooms, too!
Hop Pop: Well in that case, I'm Hopediah Plantar. This here is Sprig, Polly and Anne.
Hop Pop: Well uh, I have an id-
Hop Pop: Well, Anne, I don't wanna say I told you so.
Hop Pop: Well, Anne, think this gang can handle it?
Hop Pop: Well, I checked the logs, and it says... three years ago.
Hop Pop: Well, I don't know. Nothing especially useful. Just that the throat of this giant tomato plant is absolutely delicious eaten raw.
Hop Pop: Well, back in my day we called it "pulling a Stinky McGuire." But if you don't know Stinky, the saying don't mean much, so let's just stick with yours. (both laugh)
Hop Pop: Well, because...there's something I've never told you. Something hard to talk about. (sighs) The truth is...
Hop Pop: Well, down the hatch!
Hop Pop: Well, duh. We're not anarchists, Anne.
Hop Pop: Well, gotta find the leak, then patch it up good.
Hop Pop: Well, how about that. A restaurant.
Hop Pop: Well, it sure wasn't mine.
Hop Pop: Well, it's a good-looking poster, though. (beat) I'm gonna die!
Hop Pop: Well, kids, looks like you're in good hands here with Mr. Tritonio. Hyah! Crop Con, here I come!
Hop Pop: Well, thank you, Anne. And I want you to know that I will make an effort to be more careful about where I walk because--
Hop Pop: Well, that statue's new.
Hop Pop: Well, that was a waste of time.
Hop Pop: Well, that's pretty cool... Wait, what's wrong?
Hop Pop: Well, the living room ain't no palace, but the couch is comfy.
Hop Pop: Well, then I guess I'll just have to express myself in my own unique way.
Hop Pop: Well, this guy's quite the character.
Hop Pop: Well, we wait for someone to visit the archives.
Hop Pop: Well, would a more extreme experience make you happy, Anne?
Hop Pop: Well, yeah. I figured.
Hop Pop: Well, you grabbed for my tea first.
Hop Pop: Well, you made the money. But only if you keep your hood up. don't like you drawing so much attention to yourself.
Hop Pop: Well, you're already hurtin' me. Every time you remind me of the mistakes I made, every time you rub it in my face that I let you down. I mean, what's it gonna take for you to let this go?
Hop Pop: Well...
Hop Pop: Were things on this "Internet" resolved in peaceful and civilized ways?
Hop Pop: What are you laughing about?
Hop Pop: What do you want, Anne?
Hop Pop: What happened to the zipped lips?
Hop Pop: What in tarnation?
Hop Pop: What is this demonic nonsense?
Hop Pop: What the heck's going on down here?
Hop Pop: What the-- What's going on?
Hop Pop: What was that?
Hop Pop: What we need is you putting that piece back.
Hop Pop: What'd I tell you about pets?
Hop Pop: What's all the ruckus?
Hop Pop: What's all this rabble?
Hop Pop: What's happening to us?
Hop Pop: What's that?
Hop Pop: What?
Hop Pop: What? I won?
Hop Pop: What? No, no, no. We're going there.
Hop Pop: What? No, no. No, no, no.
Hop Pop: What? What is it, Joe?
Hop Pop: What? When?
Hop Pop: Who knew these ants were so bouncy?
Hop Pop: Whoa!
Hop Pop: Whoa, whoa there! Hungry much?
Hop Pop: Whoa.
Hop Pop: Whoa. Dang it. It's too darn muddy for me to squeeze under Bessie to see what's the trouble.
Hop Pop: Why is everything you say so aggro?
Hop Pop: Why? Because you're finally talking? Sharing a room doesn't make you friends. Being honest with each other does. In fact, if you ask me, you're better friends now than you were before.
Hop Pop: Why? Is my food not good enough for the princess?
Hop Pop: Wish I was, Anne. But you kids need supervision. Why, sometimes it feels like we have at least two wacky adventures a week!
Hop Pop: With dawn approaching, I covered my tracks and made my escape.
Hop Pop: Wow! Anne, have you been keeping a journal too?
Hop Pop: Wow! Can you do math like that too, Anne?
Hop Pop: Wow, just look at this place. Am I dressed okay? Should I have worn my silk ascot? I'll go back and get it.
Hop Pop: Wow, where'd you learn to cut like that?
Hop Pop: Wow.
Hop Pop: Y'know, the couch is still free in case there's trouble in paradise.
Hop Pop: Yeah! The king of single-tiered irrigation systems.
Hop Pop: Yeah, and they spend that life massacring all living things.
Hop Pop: Yeah, but some of your ideas could work. We'll never know unless we try. I promise from now on to actually read your suggestions.
Hop Pop: Yeah, deep down we're just a couple of softies, ain't we?
Hop Pop: Yeah, obvi. Let's go.
Hop Pop: Yeah, why'd you throw the game?
Hop Pop: Yeah. Not exactly comforting.
Hop Pop: Yeah. They really seem to like your human bumps, Anne.
Hop Pop: Yeah... (sighs) And I'm sorry I lied and drained your memory box. Can you ever forgive this old, silly frog?
Hop Pop: Yep!
Hop Pop: Yep! I've never felt better!
Hop Pop: Yep, but I am. One room, one bedtime. Lights out in five minutes.
Hop Pop: Yep.
Hop Pop: You Kidding?
Hop Pop: You blind? The big hole right there.
Hop Pop: You could always try haggling.
Hop Pop: You guys been here all day, huh?
Hop Pop: You guys coming?
Hop Pop: You know what else is on the right track? You keeping a low profile and not jumping into things without us.
Hop Pop: You know what? I'll just buy all of them. You can never have too much glue, I always say.
Hop Pop: You know, I wouldn't mind being let d--(screaming, grunting) I'm upside down.
Hop Pop: You know, Polly, even though you're still a tadpole, you certainly proved you can be on your own. Maybe it's time I give you a little more independence.
Hop Pop: You know, bargain with shopkeepers till they lower their prices.
Hop Pop: You know, he's right.
Hop Pop: You know, if we used a traditional recipe, we wouldn't have to sell Sprig.
Hop Pop: You know, it's actually kinda relaxing!
Hop Pop: You know, there's a recipe in here that doesn't need cheese.
Hop Pop: You know, this baby's got some great substitutes, all of which are delightfully harmless.
Hop Pop: You monsters!
Hop Pop: You really want this so bad? Then drop the kids and go get it!
Hop Pop: You stay away from her.
Hop Pop: You think vegetables are cool? Marcy, how'd you like to be adopted?
Hop Pop: You wanna go to the arcade, don't ya?
Hop Pop: You weren't kidding when you said you were good at this.
Hop Pop: You what?
Hop Pop: You're destroying the farm. Don't you see? Even if you win, you lose.
Hop Pop: You're right. I caused this mess, so dang it, I'm gonna clean it up! (slurps the cup and breaks it) And then I'm gonna clean that up.
Hop Pop: Yup. But maybe we can spruce it up with something a little dangerous.
Hop Pop: Zapapedes!
Hop Pop: the shame cage!
Hop Pop:(from upstairs) You're a freak!
Hunter Frog: Aah!
Hunter Frog: Ow!
Hunter frog: Chief Polly, an old man is climbing the flagpole.
Hunter frog: Oh, gosh. I forgot my house is over in Alastairtown. Ow! Ow!
Hunter: Constance!
Hunter: Constance, my cybernetic abs belong to you and you alone.
Investigator 1: Easy.
Investigator 1: I looked up "guilty" in the phone book.
Investigator 1: One knife victim without pants. We've gotta catch this sicko.
Investigator 1: Well, maybe this will jog your memory. Jelly-stained boxers found at the scene of the crime.
Investigator 2: So, you're a marathon runner, eh?
It is tha law of the streets: no loyalties, no attachment.
Ivy (fantasy): 'Sup.
Ivy: (Blushes in embarrassment) Never mind. I'm stupid. This is stupid. This is stupid.
Ivy: (chuckles) Crops are very important.
Ivy: (laughs) After you, friend.
Ivy: (screams) Run! (She grabs Sprig by the arm and takes off.)
Ivy: (shouts) Do you care about anything other than tea?! (She goes upstairs.) You just don't get me, Mom! (She slams her bedroom door, causing some tea china to fall off a shelf. Luckily, Felicia catches them with her arm, leg, and head and she growls. In Ivy's room,)
Ivy: (sighs) I've got to get out of here. (She looks at a poster that says "Adventure waits for no one.") Posters on my wall, are you trying to tell me something? (scoffs) Well, I can't just leave! There has to be another way! Well, it's hard to argue with that logic. (At the Plantar Farm, Sprig is shooting rocks with his slingshot in his room. Just as he shoots another rock, another one hits him in the head from behind.)
Ivy: A plate?
Ivy: Ah, your trip sounds amazing. Man, I've never even been out of Wartwood. (She puts the Glitter Bug she caught into Sprig's jar.)
Ivy: Ambush!
Ivy: Aw, come on, Mom. They're good enough.
Ivy: Aw, man, that sounds awesome. But Sprig and I can't. We're about to go Glitter Bug hunting.
Ivy: Aww.
Ivy: But, Mom, I'm gonna be late!
Ivy: But, Mom, me and Sprig just got started!
Ivy: Come back here! This'll be your grave!
Ivy: Come on! (sees the seats are full and groans) There's no seats left together.
Ivy: Come on, Sprig. You and I are leaving the valley. Tonight.
Ivy: Don't worry, guys. Sprig and I are ready for combat. Right?
Ivy: Eat this, you chump!
Ivy: Gotcha.
Ivy: Great. You can be my guide. Let's go!
Ivy: He means 'cause we're dating.
Ivy: Heck yeah!
Ivy: Heck, yeah, I do! (gasps) Check it out. (She points to a white Glitter Bug with colorful patterns. She and Sprig jump to the top of a tree.) All right, Sprig. Time for the super net. (She and Sprig combine their nets together, making a big net.)
Ivy: Hey, Sprig.
Ivy: Hey, Sprig. There's something I've, uh, been meaning... to ask you. I, uh... Do you, um... (clears throat) Do you think you'd wanna go out with me sometime?
Ivy: Hey, you.
Ivy: Hi-yah! (She turns off her alarm bug.) Think you can sneak up on me, alarm bug? I've been awake for hours! (She goes to her hanger and jumps up to put on her hat. She then grabs a net and kicks her bedroom door open.) Boom! (Just as she is about to leave the house, Felicia grabs her net, stopping her.)
Ivy: Hi.
Ivy: I came by earlier, but I couldn't find you. But I did find this sweet blue moon shell.
Ivy: I guess.
Ivy: I had no idea you felt this way about me, Sprig.
Ivy: I know, right?
Ivy: I'll miss you every second.
Ivy: I'm meetin' Sprig for some Glitter Bug huntin'. I told you last night, remember?
Ivy: I'm so jealous! At least when I look at my sunshell, it'll be like a piece of me was there with you.
Ivy: It's our shell. I'm really happy you found me one.
Ivy: Mom!
Ivy: Nice ambush.
Ivy: No takers, hey? Hmm. Guess we'll just stand in the back together.
Ivy: No! Come back!
Ivy: Now, let's catch some bugs. (She takes Sprig's hand.)
Ivy: Oh, no, you don't.
Ivy: Oh, okay. I like your, uh, collar.
Ivy: Oh, thank goodness! I only went along because I didn't want to hurt you. Also 'cause my mom forced me.
Ivy: Oh, yeah, Mom?! Well, me and Sprig are runnin' away and leaving Wartwood for good! So there!
Ivy: Oh, yeah, those are babies. I read that they're purple so the moms can find them if they get lost.
Ivy: Oh, yeah? Well, then... maybe I don't even wanna be your daughter!
Ivy: Oh. Thanks.
Ivy: Okay. That was fun. See ya, Sprig!
Ivy: On the count of three. One, two...
Ivy: So tell me more about your adventures on the road. I wanna hear all the details.
Ivy: Sorry, it's just... I wanna see the world, you know? Get my hands dirty, learn martial arts, things like that.
Ivy: Sprig?
Ivy: That does it! I don't want to do any of this boring, frilly garbage. I wanna travel the world and have my own adventures.
Ivy: That sounded like...
Ivy: Uh-huh. Well, sorry I'm late. My mom was on my case again. It's so annoying!
Ivy: Way ahead of you. Come on, let's go!
Ivy: We're also here to tell you we don't want to date each other and we never will.
Ivy: Well, I've had it with your nitpicking, your rules, and your tea lessons!
Ivy: Well, see you dorks later.
Ivy: Wha... Seriously? Me against you? (laughs) This is gonna be easy.
Ivy: What's wrong with it? There's no difference!
Ivy: Whoa. Thanks, Sprig. It's beautiful. But I kinda like it here. When I see it sparkle, I know I'm getting close to your place.
Ivy: Woo-hoo! Freedom. No more tea, no more swan napkins... just me, you, and the open road.
Ivy: Yeah, after all, we're perfectly in sync.
Ivy: Yeah. It was a little dirty. But I took it home and polished it up. Here's it back.
Ivy: You big dummy! It's just a shell. You can make it up to me by finally taking me on a date.
Ivy: You said you had friends in every town from here to Newtopia, right?
Jacinda: By order of Newtopia, I hereby decree that Mayor Froderick Toadstool has been appointed the new Head Toad of Toad Tower.
Jacinda: Great. The job is yours. Pending an evaluation. Toodles.
Jacinda: Mayor Toadstool I presume? I am Jacinda, official emissary of Newtopia. We have come to discuss... the events of Toad Tower.
Jacinda: Right... A lot of money. Even had to dodge some bandits to get it here safe and sound. (chuckles) Anyway, this money is for rebuilding Toad Tower. But who's to say that's all it's for, hmm? (chuckles) So pack your bags. We leave at sundown.
Jacinda: Uh, yeah. You didn't think we were gonna build the tower here, did you?
Jacinda: With Captain Grime gone, we need someone we can trust. And from what we've heard, you're the toad for the job.
Jacinda: You'd find yourself rotting in one of (voice lowers) the deepest, dankest dungeons in all of Amphibia. (normal voice) Hypothetically.
Jeremy: (chirping)
Jerry: Get back here!
Jerry: Hey! What are you doin'?
Jerry: Hiya, Sprig.
Jerry: Oh, you okay, little guy?
Joe Sparrow: (chirping)
Jonah: (muffled laugh)
Jonah: Eh? Who's there? You from the Puzzle of the Month Club?
Jonah: Ha! What're you gonna do to me now? You're just an old woman.
Jonah: Here I come, Sadie.
Jonah: It really is you.
Jonah: It's true.
Jonah: Name's Jonah.
Jonah: Now then, can you tell me where she's been all this time?
Jonah: Oh, yes! Son, you just made this lonely old frog (inhales) very happy. Mmm.
Jonah: Sadie Croaker, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for 30 years.
Jonah: Sadie Croaker...prepare to die! (manic laughter)
Jonah: Sadie, Sadie, Sadie. You thought you got the best of me in Bogwater Canyon, but I haven't forgotten.
Jonah: Sadie.
Jonah: Sadie? Sadie Croaker sent you?
Jonah: The Guild would surely take me back if I took you down. Thirty years I been searching for ya, but you hid too well. But now, thanks to this weird little frog leading me straight to you, your time is up.
Jonah: This is incredible. I've been searching for Sadie for 30 years!
Jonah: You're old!
Juliet: I got the tall one. Talk about your drumsticks.
Juliet: Yeah, we're hungry.
Juniper: All right, you love birds, that's enough.
Juniper: Mmm, delectable.
Juniper: Ooh. Looks like I've got the geezer. Aged to perfection. Juliet?
Kids: Time to eat!
Kids: Time to eat! Time to eat!
King Andrias: (blows raspberry) Oh, etiquette smetiquette! Ooh! And what do we have here?
King Andrias: (chuckles, then laughs exuberantly) Delightful!
King Andrias: (clears throat)
King Andrias: (laughing)
King Andrias: (laughing) Oh, bring it in, you guys. Bring it in.
King Andrias: (laughs) The thumb of approval. And here's a thumb for you, Anne.
King Andrias: According to this book, it's a magical artifact that is thousands of years old. Apparently, my ancestors used it to visit entirely different worlds. They were peaceful explorers, scientists, if you will. These three stones are the key to getting it working again. They need to be recharged.
King Andrias: Always sad to see someone go, isn't it? I have a proposition for you, Marcy, and I think you'll find it very interesting.
King Andrias: Bingo! (laughs) Ta-da! Take a gander.
King Andrias: But now, let's get down to business, shall we? Getting you girls back home, safe and sound. Hmm... Alas, without the music box, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. Marcy doesn't have it, and, well, I assume you don't have it either.
King Andrias: But wait! Marcy, look!
King Andrias: Hello, Plantar family!
King Andrias: It's so good to finally meet you!
King Andrias: No. It must be thousands of years old, judging by the smell. Whew!
King Andrias: Oh, way older than that actually.
King Andrias: Psych! (laughing) But wait, what's this? The Royal Credit Card! It will grant you access to do anything in Newtopia. Be safe with this now. Wars have been waged for less.
King Andrias: So ask me if I found out anything about the box.
King Andrias: Steal my thunder, why don't you? But yes! Boom! Eh, eh?
King Andrias: The book mentions three different temples, each channeling a different kind of energy. And once the stones are recharged...
King Andrias: The pieces are starting to fall into place. It's time for the game to begin.
King Andrias: This will require further study in the deepest of our archives. Give me a few days to work with this information. At that time, we shall reconvene and set a glorious plan in motion.
King Andrias: Until then, my dear Plantars, go forth and enjoy the sights of Newtopia. We've booked you a suite at the Hemisphere Hotel, my treat. And here... pick a hand!
King Andrias: Well, even I have to admit I'm surprised. This is one of the most comprehensive libraries in all of Amphibia. Maybe we missed a book somewhere.
King Andrias: What the... Huh?
King Andrias: Whoa-ho. Let's rein those snails in for a sec. The book only gives the location of one temple. Besides, you still have a lot of preparing to do before you set off.
King Andrias: Why, this is marvelous news! Come, come, let's see it.
King Andrias: Wonderful to see you all again.
King Andrias: Yes, yes, a photo... (chuckles) Let's see here. Hmm, how peculiar. Marcy, didn't you say the gems were colored? Look here. They're... They're gray.
King Andrias: You folks want a giant tissue? Seriously, you would not believe the size of these tissues. (chuckles) I'll get you one.
King Andrias: You must be Anne. 'Sup? (to Marcy) Um, am I saying it right? 'Sup?
Kraken: (growls)
Kraken: (roaring)
Kraken: (roars)
Kraken: (screeches)
Lady Olivia: Good evening, Master Marcy. Anne Boonchuy and the Plantars have arrived for your...
Lady Olivia: Okay, frog family. You're about to meet King Andrias. This is a big deal.
Lady Toad Soldier: Hey Greg, what do you think that is?
Lady Toad Soldier: Whoo, yeah.
Large Toad Soldier: (offscreen) Support? (onscreen) I got support right here. (pulls a wedgie out of the Purple Newt's soldier as the newts gasps)
Large Toad Soldier: Go? (falls and everyone gasps)
Large Toad Soldier: Well, you weaklings were supposed to catch me.
Lavender, Ginger, and Rosemary: (chanting) Theater night, theater night!
Lavender: And creepy. Let's play instead!
Lavender: Come on Maddie, play with us!
Lavender: Grow up?
Lavender: I wish we were older. And then, Maddie would want to play with us like she used to.
Lavender: We're not playing, we're making a witchy spell.
Leader: Well, well, what do we have... (removes his helmet, revealing himself to be Barry) here?
Leopold Loggle: That took 20 years to carve.
Little frog: Your turn.
Lloyd: Gary? The name's Lloyd.
Lloyd: Hey, buddy. Do you know where I live?
Loggle: (sighs) Well, Loggle, another day, another step closer to bankrupt-- Eh?
Loggle: (sobbing) No! I'm too beautiful to die!
Loggle: Absolutely... no way.
Loggle: Absolutely...not!
Loggle: As a matter of fact, I can... not.
Loggle: At least the party's "lit" now, Anne.
Loggle: Be careful, you kids. It's cursed, I tell ya. Cursed!
Loggle: Few have made it to the Doom Tree alive, fewer yet returned. It holds many secrets that mortals dare not--
Loggle: Give me that!
Loggle: Good choice!
Loggle: Hey, Hopadiah! (exclaims) What brings you here?
Loggle: Hop Pop, no! That's more glue.
Loggle: I do...n't. I don't.
Loggle: I think she was born that old. She looked exactly the same when I was a kid.
Loggle: I'll tell you what gives. This doesn't even begin to cover the damages you've caused to my shop. You're gonna have to give me something else. Come on. Pony up.
Loggle: I'm Loggle.
Loggle: I'm a complicated man!
Loggle: No, no, no, not the statue. No!
Loggle: No. No!
Loggle: Not this again.
Loggle: Of course I do... n't. I don't.
Loggle: Oh! (sobbing) Yes. Oh!
Loggle: Oh, Hop Pop. All you need for that is this. (Puts hand over heart)
Loggle: Oh. (clicking) Oh! I like this. You can go.
Loggle: Okay, okay. I got a map to the Doom Tree right here, but it'll cost ya.
Loggle: Old smithing accident. You don't want to know.
Loggle: Or you could do that for free.
Loggle: Switched over to wood after that. Anyhow, I'm afraid I can't do much for you. That cane was made with wood from the incredibly rare, extremely dangerous Doom Tree!
Loggle: Tripped on an anvil. Landed neck-first on a metal pipe. Pierced my voice box clean through!
Loggle: Uh-huh. Oh, oh, yes. Well, aren't you fascinating? Yes, you are.
Loggle: Wait. The robots change shifts?
Loggle: What the-- What's going on?
Loggle: What? No, I meant you need this. (Pulls glue out of chest pocket.) Nothing stronger. This stuff will fix your shrub. Heck, it'll fix your house!
Loggle: What? What is this, uh...
Loggle: Whoa, Whoa!
Loggle: You serious?!
Maddie and Marcy: (gasps)
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs and screams)
Maddie and Marcy: (laughs)
Maddie and Marcy: (screams)
Maddie and Marcy: (the do their own unique handshake) Creepy spiders!
Maddie and Polly: (both laughing) (barks)
Maddie and the Sisters: Aah!
Maddie's Sisters: Uh...
Maddie: (even more impressed) Wow! No one's ever interested in what I do! They usually run away screaming!
Maddie: (gasps) Oh, what did you do to my book?! It's ruined! This is why I don't spend time with you anymore because you're annoying, little babies!
Maddie: (groans)
Maddie: (intrigued) I'm impressed you knew that! Do you also have an interest in the dark arts?
Maddie: (screams)
Maddie: (whispers) It will be.
Maddie: A really rotted corpse.
Maddie: Aah!
Maddie: Aah! I'm gonna kill them! (runs back upstairs)
Maddie: Almost there... (laughs)
Maddie: And lastly, a high-five from your new best bud.
Maddie: Assorted limbs.
Maddie: Chicka-lisk, the Storm Bearer. It's an honor to see him. You know, before he kills us.
Maddie: Dad, have you seen my spell book? I need to perform a level 2 resurrection with my apprentice.
Maddie: Fine, give me a few minutes to wrap this up, and we'll play.
Maddie: Fleafy!
Maddie: Fresh soil from a graveyard.
Maddie: Ha!
Maddie: Hey, hey! Get out of here! Necromancy is really advanced magic. It said that only level two witches can pull it off. I've only done level spells up so-
Maddie: Hi, Rosemary, Ginger, and Lavender. What are you doing here?
Maddie: Hiiiii, Spriiiiiiig...
Maddie: I'm feeling like a beautiful friendship is about to start. Wanna be my apprentice and help me bring a dead flea back to life?
Maddie: I'm in a middle of a spell. We can play tomorrow.
Maddie: I'm so done with my sisters. Look what they did to my spell book!
Maddie: I've seen your death in my mind.
Maddie: If we're gonna bring this flea back to life, we need a few more ingredients. First up, bile of a vomit bird.
Maddie: It's a long story. I used to play with them all the time. Especially, juggling; that was their favorite. Then, I got my own interests. Magic became my passion, my calling. I didn't have time to waste on kids stuff anymore. And ever since then, they've been so annoying.
Maddie: Look, Mrs. Jonkins is counting on me to bring her pet, Fleafy, back to life.
Maddie: No! That took all morning!
Maddie: No. No. Hey, perfect!
Maddie: Nonsense. Being a witch is a big responsibility, Marcy. I've got more important things to do now than babysit.
Maddie: Oh, no they didn't!
Maddie: Oh, oops. You're Anne's friend, right?
Maddie: See you soon, hubby...
Maddie: Seed of swordspine, one cup of dirt from a widow's grave, add both to bubbling bog water, and finally, one half drop of worm snake venom. Steady... steady...
Maddie: She smells like wet leaves and fungus. I love it.
Maddie: Someone dug a bunch of holes and stole stuff from everyone in town. I even lost a talisman that, if it fell into the wrong hands, would bring an end to all...living--I've said too much.
Maddie: Then, some big ol' ticks.
Maddie: Uh, oh.
Maddie: Wait, Ginger?!
Maddie: We did it! We did it! I'm finally a level 2 witch! (notices a growing shadow and looks up) Huh?
Maddie: Well now I definitely don't have time. Go home and help dad with the bakery or something. I swear, sometimes, I wish you three would grow up.
Maddie: Well, this is me. (groans). I hope my sisters are asleep. I do not want to deal with them right now.
Maddie: What have I told you about playing with my stuff?!
Maddie: What's the matter with you three?!
Maddie: Whatever. They won't stop me from reaching level two. Let's get to resurrecting.
Maddie: You wish. Sup?
Maggie: Aw, jeez, Sash. I was just playin'. Here.
Maggie: Hey, Boobchuy! Whatcha eatin'? A puke bun? (cackles)
Maggie: Oh, happy birthday. Give me that!
Maggie: Oh, yeah? Or else what?
Mail Frog:  Delivery for Wartwood Delivery delayed 
Mail Frog:  Delivery for Wartwood Delivery today 
Mail-Fly: (buzzes)
Male Frog: Thank you, Mr. Plantar. Don't call us, we'll call you.
Male Newt: Ooh!
Male frog: You have the voice of an angel.
Man: It's a standoff.
Marcy and Hop Pop: (laughs)
Marcy and the Plantars: (scream)
Marcy and the Plantars: (screams)
Marcy: "A dangerous room. What to do? Don't be jealous of my hue."
Marcy: "Any commander whose wart falls may never set foot inside these temple walls." Looks like you only get one shot at this. One shot is all I need. But first, to set up the board...
Marcy: "Don't be jealous of my hue." It's a reference to green, the color of envy.
Marcy: "Only the worthy will have the wisdom to choose whether it's more important to win, or have the humility to lose. A choice was made to save thy friends and, honestly, doesn't that make you a winner in the end?"
Marcy: 'Sup, triple B?
Marcy: (after drawing the "straw-lrus" in her journal) Oh! I'll take it! It's, oh, let me guess... 28 coppers?
Marcy: (chuckles) Don't worry, dude. I got this.
Marcy: (chuckles) Essence of Heron's bane. Just what the doctor ordered.
Marcy: (chuckles) I know what you mean. First things first though. We have to find Sasha.
Marcy: (chuckles) Now go. Follow your heart.
Marcy: (clears her throat) So, Anne, I think we can both agree everything's riding on this last temple.
Marcy: (coughing) Fascinating.
Marcy: (covers the flower's mouth) Okay, that's enough. You okay?
Marcy: (falls) Aah!
Marcy: (gasps) I don't believe it! It's flipwart!
Marcy: (gasps) It's alive. It's alive! Or there's a slight breeze.
Marcy: (gasps) It's so cute! It's got a folksy country vibe.
Marcy: (gasps) This leads to the top floor. That means there's only one puzzle left. Come on, team!
Marcy: (gestures to her smiling friend) And this is my friend, Anne... (Anne pokes her cheek, which she holds.) Ow.
Marcy: (giggles) Anne, quit it.
Marcy: (gives a thumbs up) You got it!
Marcy: (groans) I need more bug-accinos. B-R-B. Whoa! Ah, dang it! Tell me that tapestry wasn't hundreds of years old.
Marcy: (groans) This is the last book and still nothing on the music box.
Marcy: (grunts)
Marcy: (grunts, screams)
Marcy: (holding Anne's cheeks) Are you ok? Did you hit your head? Are you crazy now?
Marcy: (holding a razor) Too short?
Marcy: (holding her nose) I mean, it will liquefy your lungs if you breathe too much of it, so...
Marcy: (joints cracking) Okay, if my studies are correct, then...
Marcy: (looks up) Huh? (grunts as Anne pushes her out of the way)
Marcy: (panting, groans)
Marcy: (pops out of the book pile) Hiya, Plantar family!
Marcy: (puts her bangs over her right eye) Do I ever!
Marcy: (scoffs) Such a basic response. This is gonna be easy.
Marcy: (screams) Branson! No, bad boy.
Marcy: (sighs) Well, if we're gonna lose, might as well lose all the way.
Marcy: (sighs) You know, the more I think about it, maybe sending a servant to get the music box isn't such a good idea. We need someone looking after that thing the second Hop Pop gets it back. Someone we trust.
Marcy: (squeals) Can't wait!
Marcy: (waves to the merchant) Hello!
Marcy: A giant flipwart board?
Marcy: A little town called Wartwood.
Marcy: Aah! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha!
Marcy: Ah, good. Because I already fly-mailed Newtopia's best armorer, and he's on his way right now to give you a whole new look!
Marcy: All right! Let's go.
Marcy: All right, gang! There should be three challenges just like the two other temp-les?
Marcy: All right, guys! Let's do this thing! (echoing)
Marcy: All right, guys. It's hammer time!
Marcy: All right, so what if it cheats? Still not enough to beat me.
Marcy: All right, this should be the final room.
Marcy: And I'm the personification of metamorphosis!
Marcy: And can we also agree that you need some new gear already?
Marcy: Anne, only I've studied barbari-ant biology. It has to be me.
Marcy: Anne, right now you have to follow your head, not your heart. The Plantars got you here, to me. It's time to let them get back to their lives. Why don't you guys take the day to say goodbye?
Marcy: Anne, trust me. I can handle this. Now let's get going. Mission, engage!
Marcy: Anne, what are you doing?
Marcy: Are you kidding?! I've read every Cynthia Coven book, five times! I searched all over Newtopia for someone who could teach me, but magic users are so rare these days.
Marcy: As someone who goes hard into her hobbies, I relate. But, don't you think you should still make time for them occasionally?
Marcy: Awesome!
Marcy: Baby, I'm running towards you! How do you feel about that?
Marcy: Because it wasn't worth you guys getting hurt. I got so caught up in proving I was smart enough to win, I couldn't see what I was about to lose.
Marcy: Big news, everyone. I finished my preparations for the--Whaa...Is this your house? Oh, it's so rustic and cute. When was it built? Third century? No. No, no, no. Second. Yes, of course. Okay, when it was af--
Marcy: But a summer cut might be cute. (She moves her fingers like scissors. Anne gets annoyed and slaps her hand away.)
Marcy: But don't worry, because none of them were Marcy Wu, head of the chess club, master RTS player, straight-A student, except for gym but only because I was reading in class, which only proves my point!
Marcy: But we're not back home, Anne. And I've been doing just fine by myself.
Marcy: Can you translate ancient Amphibian runes?
Marcy: Check it out!
Marcy: Check it out! My first successful curse! Some kind of horrible abomination!
Marcy: Colorful characters.
Marcy: Congrats, brah. You finally know what it takes to go the distance. For what is true strength without persistence.
Marcy: Crockside conifer. What a find! And they said compiling a plant-cyclopedia would be boring.
Marcy: Did I learn an entire dead language just for today? You better believe I did! Now, let's see. "Keeper of the box, one strong of mind, three trials await, that will return the stones' shine." Hey, looks like there's three trials, guys. And here we go.
Marcy: Did something happen?
Marcy: Didn't what?
Marcy: Don't worry, everyone. I'll just play well enough so that none of you gets hurt. It'll be like hard mode! (chuckles) Fun!
Marcy: Done! Guys, this way! (grunts) Come on! Insta-vines! Bred 'em myself.
Marcy: Doot doot doot doot dooot do!
Marcy: Each temple has a theme. And this one appears to be strength.
Marcy: Enjoy, everyone! This place makes the best beetle burger in all of Newtopia!
Marcy: Fair enough.
Marcy: First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood!
Marcy: First day! First day! First day! First day! Woo!
Marcy: Get ready, Anne. There's a good chance you're next.
Marcy: Good enough! (clears throat) I'm Marcy Wu!
Marcy: Good point. Gotta get equipped for a mega-quest like this. Armor to buy, maps to study, weapons to forge. This is gonna take a few days.
Marcy: Gosh, Anne was right. It's the perfect little farm town! (The frog captured by the dragonfly flies over and burps in the background.) And now, to introduce myself.
Marcy: Gotta admit, this temple's good, but not good enough. Gotcha! We win!
Marcy: Guys, I've done the research. Plus, it's me, remember? I said I won't let you down and I meant it. Now, who wants to hit that button?
Marcy: Guys, it's leading us to the next temple!
Marcy: Guys, killing the vibe. Thank you. Now, where was I? "Few have the brains to make it to this door, but are you wise enough to solve what's in store?" Yep! Let's go.
Marcy: Gyromitra esculenta. Also known as brain mushrooms.
Marcy: HI there! My name is Marcy. Do you have any time to talk about its unique architectural history?
Marcy: Ha! Got it!
Marcy: Ha! Here we are. The final puzzle.
Marcy: Ha! Solved it. Okay guys, listen up. Green is the safe color. Get it?
Marcy: He's still alive! These bugs take a while to digest their food. Look!
Marcy: Here's the plan. We're going to have to plant these around the room. That way she gets a nose-full. They're set to go off in five minutes, so move quickly. Also, the queen is nearly blind, but hears really well. So be very, very quiet.
Marcy: Hey Sash.
Marcy: Hey!
Marcy: Hey, I'm just glad you're okay. It's obvious you mean a lot to Anne.
Marcy: Hey, come on. There's a puzzle here somewhere. Everyone, look for clues.
Marcy: Hey, hey. Don't stress, guys. This is no big deal.
Marcy: Hey, you guys wanna go straight to the next temple tonight, or take a break first?
Marcy: Hey. Thanks for having my back.
Marcy: Hi! My name is Marcy. What's your name?
Marcy: Hi, there!
Marcy: Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Marcy: Hmm. I wonder...
Marcy: Hmm. I'ma push it. Bop.
Marcy: Hmm. Looks like this is a two-person job. Someone go stand on the other green square.
Marcy: Hmm?
Marcy: Holy cow!
Marcy: Huh?
Marcy: Huh?? What? No! Guys, this thing cheats!
Marcy: I can still save him.
Marcy: I did, 'cause I studied them.
Marcy: I don't know. Back home, Sasha always decided the plan.
Marcy: I don't wanna give anything away, but it's gonna be pretty cool.
Marcy: I got it, temple. I wasn't smart enough to win, but I can find the exit, okay?
Marcy: I just need to see the music box. Then it's go-time, gang. (She throws some punches.) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah-ya! (Sees everyone staring and stops.) Sorry, sorry. Long flight. A lot of pent-up energy. Anyway, music box.
Marcy: I should be able to triangulate its location with a bit of work. (inhales) Whoo! This just keeps getting better!
Marcy: I still have way more pieces. If I can just attack from a different angle, I should be fine. (nervous chuckle)
Marcy: I wouldn't say I "hang out" here, but yes! Staying at the castle has been awesome!
Marcy: I'm sure I can handle the preparations here by myself. I'll just come pick you up on the way to the first... (grunts when Anne hugs her) ...temple.
Marcy: I'm sure they'll work it out by the time we get there.
Marcy: I'm sure we'll be fine. Probably.
Marcy: I'm trying to throw this game, but it won't let me! I need your help.
Marcy: I've changed, remember?
Marcy: It does seem simpler.
Marcy: It was a garage band the three of us had back home.
Marcy: It's a strategy game I learned to play in Newtopia. It's like chess but to the max. I got so good at it, I even beat King Andrias.
Marcy: Lady Olivia... (squeals) Meet Anne, one of the friends I was telling you about. Turns out she got transported to Frog Valley.
Marcy: Leave that snail alone!
Marcy: Let me guess. Tried to eat you?
Marcy: Let's just say I have a perfect record when it comes to missions.
Marcy: Look at this! The gang finally back together again! Now, come on. Let's get back to Wartwood and get these frogs some water.
Marcy: Look, the point is, I'm not gonna let you guys down.
Marcy: Mission success!
Marcy: My name's Marcy!
Marcy: Nice work, Anna-Banana. Fun to play too.
Marcy: No way. A secret library wing. Did you know about this?
Marcy: No!
Marcy: No! Hop Pop, Anne! Who cares about this stupid game? I forfeit! (grunts) It's not working! Maybe I have to flip the big wart too. (grunts)
Marcy: No! No! No! If we turn that thing on, who knows what we'll end up? We should bring it to King Andrias so he can tell us how to use it correctly to get home.
Marcy: No, it's the puzzle! Also, I'm pretty sure that's a magnetic field holding her up.
Marcy: No, no, no. That's the temple.
Marcy: No, no. They're with me. The Plantars traveled here all the way from the valley.
Marcy: No. And since I lost, I'm not allowed back in the temple. You guys will have to try it all again without me.
Marcy: No. It can't be. Guys, this is where we charge the stone!
Marcy: No... Was it bad?
Marcy: Nonsense. Once Hop Pop gets the box back, we'll just send a servant to pick it up. More efficient that way.
Marcy: Not quite. These are stink shrooms!
Marcy: Not quite. Watch.
Marcy: Now, come on. Who's ready to go to Newtopia? And write up a detailed report!
Marcy: Now, let's see how they respond.
Marcy: Of "corpse" not, Hop Pop.
Marcy: Of course! Why didn't I think of it sooner? The temple wasn't just testing for intelligence. It was also testing for humility!
Marcy: Oh my gosh, Anne. I'm about to beat my all-time record!
Marcy: Oh! I'm into that. Anne? Anne?
Marcy: Oh! I'm so excited.
Marcy: Oh, Sasha. It's crazy! The king of Amphibia told us the music box can transport us back home! But the stones need to be charged at three temples first! This is the third temple!
Marcy: Oh, come on! (Starts stomping on her cape) There wasn't even any fire this time!
Marcy: Oh, great. Did you know this entire town is built on top of a swamp but never sinks? That's because the designers knew exactly how heavy to make everything.
Marcy: Oh, just my journal. I like jottin' down theories and observations. You know, all about indigenous fauna, medicinal techniques, customs and nuances of Amphibious species-based caste systems... (Polly zones out as she speaks.) Sometimes I even do drawings.
Marcy: Oh, my gosh! Are you a vagrant? Is that an accordion? Is that eye really gone?
Marcy: Oh, my gosh! That was the coolest thing ever! Some kind of low-grade fire curse?
Marcy: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. They're here!
Marcy: Oh, my gosh. Okay, so I wanna know everything that's happened to you since you got here. You got any photos?
Marcy: Oh, please! Like I could forget you guys. Penny? Sprout?
Marcy: Oh, right. I finished my prep and we're ready for the first temple!
Marcy: Oh, sorry, sorry. But it all turned out okay, right? Anyway, isn't vegetation in Amphibia just the coolest?
Marcy: Oh, you're right. You think we can pull it off? Sasha's the sleepover queen, not us.
Marcy: Okay, Marce. Be cool. Just get out there and introduce yourself with confidence.
Marcy: Okay, we should be arriving there shortly! (screams)
Marcy: Okay, white goes first, so it's our move. Let's flip this wart!
Marcy: Okay. Plan is we're gonna sneak behind enemy lines and drive the ant queen away. With her gone, the rest should retreat.
Marcy: Ooh! Nice.
Marcy: Right? Now let's get out there and conquer these bad boys.
Marcy: Sash! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe-
Marcy: See you on the other side.
Marcy: Should've started with that one.
Marcy: So, according to my research, these three ancient temple are filled with difficult challenges to keep out the unworthy. All we have to do is complete the challenges, and then we can charge the stone.
Marcy: So, both sides have a wart, right? And they're trying to flip it! Each piece has a different set of abilities. These archers, for example, can only attack in a straight line. Oh, I love this game!
Marcy: So, what song should we play at the battle?
Marcy: So, you haven't found a way home either, huh?
Marcy: Sorry we lost, Sash.
Marcy: Speak for yourself, look at that armor! How did you find us?!
Marcy: Steady, steady.
Marcy: Sup, bro'seph. Do you even lift?
Marcy: Thanks, Sasha.
Marcy: Thanks, Sprig, Polly.
Marcy: That doesn't sound good. (Finds Maddie and her sisters, gets excited) No froggin' way! A curse user?! Here?!
Marcy: That thing has somehow increased the room's gravitational force.
Marcy: That's called being in the zone, Anne. It's pretty much my superpower.
Marcy: The gravity's back to normal! You did it, Sash!
Marcy: The gravity's too much. I can't move.
Marcy: The humble seed. So much potential for growth!
Marcy: The king has asked me to stop them before they turn Newtopia into a giant anthill. (To prove her point, she crushes the model of the cuty with a model of what said anthill will look like.)
Marcy: The last thing we should do is separate again, now that we're so close to finding our way home.
Marcy: There you go, bud.
Marcy: They're designed to release pheromones that should drive the queen away instantly. But we will have to fight our way through a bloodthirsty hoard of ants.
Marcy: This first temple is said to specifically challenge your intelligence. So I'm pretty sure it's full of puzzles. No frog, toad or newt in history has been able to survive it.
Marcy: This is gonna be a cinch, guys. Trust me, I know these tunnels better than anyone... (Screams as she falls down a hole: Anne catches her by the cape and pulls her up. chuckles and gives a thumbs-up) Thanks. Okay. Note to self: Do not step in holes.
Marcy: This is so cool. A store just for seeds? Boy, we could be there for hours!
Marcy: Those two seem a bit off.
Marcy: Three, two, one...
Marcy: Trust me, okay?
Marcy: Ugh! Why won't you just let me go?
Marcy: Ugh. Come on, Anna Banana. I'll be fine.
Marcy: Uh-huh.
Marcy: Uh...everything okay over there? Can someone please hit the button?
Marcy: Up you go!
Marcy: Wait a second.
Marcy: Wait. Shh! Get down! (the queen growls) It's the queen.
Marcy: Watering the plants, watering the plants.
Marcy: We did it!
Marcy: We did it! One down, two to go. (laughs) How fun is this? Yeah! (laughs) Whoo!
Marcy: We don't have a choice, Anne. You wanna get home, right? Then we've gotta play or we'll never recharge the stone.
Marcy: We'll have to be extra careful. If one thing goes wrong... (In leaning on the table, she nearly topples it) Whoa! (chuckles) Flimsy table.
Marcy: Welcome to Amygdala Woods, everyone, home to the first temple.
Marcy: Well met, Lady Olivia.
Marcy: Well, come on. I just know the answers are down there waiting for us.
Marcy: Well, even if we find a way home, it's pointless without Sasha.
Marcy: Well, no worries. I think I got it figured out. Anne, do you remember when we studied insect migration patterns in biology class?
Marcy: Well, since the weather warmed up, those ants have been sending scouting parties deeper into our territory. In fact, I predict a full-scale invasion is just around the corner.
Marcy: Well, this can't be right. Lift to enter, "brah?"
Marcy: Well, we've got a big journey ahead. I'll explain everything on the way. Come on, Joe. Joe? (gasps) Joe Sparrow!
Marcy: Well, you are the master. See you at the sacrificial grove tomorrow for an unholy ritual!
Marcy: Well, you didn't have to. I was about to get out of the way, myself.
Marcy: What am I doing?
Marcy: What's wrong with your little sisters?
Marcy: What?
Marcy: What? Are you serious?
Marcy: Whoa, there boss. Think you're strong to get across?
Marcy: Whoa, this thing's got, like, a zillion permutations. If this temple thinks it can beat me, it's got another thing coming.
Marcy: Whoa, whoa, whoa. It doesn't really make sense for you to go back to Wartwood.
Marcy: Whoo! What did I tell ya? This temple is toast! Consider the stone charged, baby! (hums)
Marcy: Whoopsies!
Marcy: Woo! Look out Amphibia! It's Marcy's first day in Wartwood!
Marcy: Yeah! I mean, it's worked out for us so far, right? Come on, stand up!
Marcy: Yeah, you too.
Marcy: Yeesh. They didn't even color in the lines.
Marcy: You didn't tell me you were writing a song. Let's do it. I mean, if that's okay with you, Sasha?
Marcy: You won't. I promise.
Marcy: You're right. It is perfect.
Marcy: You've definitely got skill, no doubt. But it's time you learn what strength is all about.
Mariah's Mother: No, I'm proud of you. All that hipping and hopping was breathtaking.
Mariah's Mother: Oh, Mariah.
Mariah: Don't you get it, Mother? I know you want me to be a ballerina, but my heart belongs to hip-hop. (She performs a brief breakdance.) Are you disappointed?
Mariah: Oh, Mother.
Marnie: (gulps) Greetings. Come to try your luck at my fun and exciting game?
Marnie: Ah-ah-ah! Once something is on the prize wall, the only way to get it back is to win it. Sorry, hon, Bizarre Bazaar rules.
Marnie: Backpack?
Marnie: Oh, you mean the magical pouch of mystery. Who can say where it came from? Or how?
Martha(coming in): Ooh. The little one got away. Must not have eaten any of my cookies. Were they not sweet enough? Did I goof the recipe? Oh, dearie me.
Martha: (evil laughter) I've been looking all over for you.
Martha: Ha! Huh? (laughs)
Martha: Here's some fresh cookies.
Martha: Huh? (roars)
Martha: Oh, dear. You're in way over your head, sweetie.
Martha: Oh, we sure did.
Martha: Please, warm yourselves by the fire.
Martha: Same to you, dearie. We're horned bullfrogs.
Martha: We'll make you a deal. Four rooms for the price of one. What do you say?
Math Teacher: Anne! Anne, get back here!
Math Teacher: Not again.
Math Teacher: Okay, so then you carry the three and-- (sighs)
Mayor Toadstool (chuckles): I gotta admit, I missed it!
Mayor Toadstool: (chuckles) Yeah, hypothetically, what would happen if I refused?
Mayor Toadstool: (groaning) Never again, Toadie. Never again.
Mayor Toadstool: (huffing) Oh, boy. Gotta cut back on them cricket nuggets. Whoo!
Mayor Toadstool: (inhales) Ah... Just breathe in that country air, Toadie. I can't believe I'm saying it, but this town's kinda growing on me.
Mayor Toadstool: All right! Let the annual potluck begin! Let's get to tastin' those dishes. Mmm! That is "scrumptious." Oh! Ooh! What have we here? (chomping) Oh, that is delicious! Yeah! Excellent effort! And last, but not least-- (sighs) the Plantars. What filth have you cooked up this ti-- Hmm? Tomato? That's awfully dangerous. (chuckles) Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!
Mayor Toadstool: All right, Stumpy, what do we got here?
Mayor Toadstool: All right, everyone. Get your teams together and start rehearsing. Wartwood is having a Battle of the Bands.
Mayor Toadstool: All right, folks. It's time! (chuckles) As you all know, the Frog of the Year goes to the most selfless, noble, blah, blah, blah... Let's get on with it.
Mayor Toadstool: Alright, folks, gather round. I got one more announcement. Now, as I understand, you three girls will be leaving us soon?
Mayor Toadstool: And this year's Frog of the Year award goes to... Well, this can't be right. Anne Boonchuy?!
Mayor Toadstool: Are you kidding me, Toadie? I just bought myself a 12-hour nap. Why don't you take a little time for yourself?
Mayor Toadstool: Come on, Anne!
Mayor Toadstool: Don't sass me Goose-lily. Hit the lights!
Mayor Toadstool: Gosh dang it, I tried to fight it, but I have to say, even I'm a little impressed with how you just saved the town from a raging inferno. Here. This belongs to you.
Mayor Toadstool: Heck, yeah! Everybody, line up!
Mayor Toadstool: I do. Are you people out of your frog-dang minds?! She don't deserve to host a party!
Mayor Toadstool: I'm looking forward to seeing this thing go down in flames.
Mayor Toadstool: I've just been informed that the next act has been canceled. So give it up for your final contestant, Grimetime!
Mayor Toadstool: Just simmer down now! Come on, simmer down. Market stops for no one. Y'all can welcome back the Plantars after business hours.
Mayor Toadstool: Ladies and gentlefrogs, I give you, The Sharps!
Mayor Toadstool: Nothing's unbeatable! Everyone, Chicka-lisk formation!
Mayor Toadstool: Oh, help me, Toadie.
Mayor Toadstool: Oh, this is gonna be a long night.
Mayor Toadstool: Ooh. And is it, uh, fresh?
Mayor Toadstool: Point is, we could all use some levity. So let's consult the Wheel of Fun.
Mayor Toadstool: Simmer down now.
Mayor Toadstool: Simmer down, everyone. Simmer down. Ahem. Now I know we've all been a little on edge since Sasha and Captain Grime came to Wartwood.
Mayor Toadstool: That don't mean we don't have to count them, Toadie.
Mayor Toadstool: That's definitely had its bumps.
Mayor Toadstool: Things have been really boring without you four causing mayhem and learning emotional lessons.
Mayor Toadstool: Uh-huh. If y'all die, who'll I embezzle money from? Huh?
Mayor Toadstool: Wait, he's stone?
Mayor Toadstool: Wait, leave? As in leave Wartwood?
Mayor Toadstool: We have a formation for everything!
Mayor Toadstool: Welcome, everyone, to the Battle of the Bands. Goose-lily and I will be your judges for this evening. So, what do you say we get things started?
Mayor Toadstool: Well, I've seen enough. Grime wins!
Mayor Toadstool: Well, it's certainly charming. I just hope there's a very cool guitar solo about to drop.
Mayor Toadstool: Well, there goes the school money, Toadie.
Mayor Toadstool: What'd I tell you, Toadie? She's gonna be the worst Frog of the Year ever. (Ever echoes)
Mayor Toadstool: Why am I in the barn? What day is it?
Mayor Toadstool: Why am I not surprised? Typical Plantars. Giant monsters, property damage, putting the entire town in danger.
Mayor Toadstool: Why, I do declare! This is the best dish the Plantar family has ever brought to a potluck!
Mayor Toadstool: Win? No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, it's better than usual, but it's still terrible. Last place, as usual.
Mayor Toadstool: Yeah, yeah. Don't mention it. Now come on, everyone. Let's try to salvage this party, shall we?
Mayor Toadstool: Yeah. And that party is supposed to demonstrate the Frog of the Year's selflessness. Anne isn't selfless. Far from it.
Mayor Toadstool: You folks should know the way to the shame cage by now. Hurry along. All right, boys, light it up.
Mean Girl #1: Oh, how cute. Now beat it. These swings are ours.
Mean Girl #1: Yeah, we're out of here. Enjoy your swings, babies.
Mean Girl #2: This is getting weird.
Mechanics: Hup, hup, hup, hup.
Merchant: Fresh crickets, ma'am? Always fresh.
Merchant: Iced flies! Get your iced flies over here!
Merchant: Worms! We got worms!
Micro-Angelo: Meep.
Mire: (gurgling)
Mire: (raspy breathing)
Mire: (roars)
Mole: (roars)
Monroe (cutting in front of him): Sylvia Sundew! Would you do me the honor of this dance?
Monroe: (chuckles)
Monroe: Come along, Sylvia. No need to waste time with losers.
Monroe: Ha-ha! Classic, gullible Hopediah!
Monroe: Him? Ha! He can't dance.
Monroe: Hold tight, now. Watch me now.
Monroe: Is that so? Then let's settle this.
Monroe: Oho, yikes. Well, I think it's clear who the winner is.
Monroe: Wha--She's as freaky as he is! The horror!
Monroe: You're not seriously thinking of going to this thing, are you? Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself like last year's barn dance fiasco. (laughs) See you around, old-timer.
Monster: (distorted voice) I'll never manipulate people--
Monster: (gasps)
Monster: (groaning)
Monster: (groans) (sinister laughter)
Monster: (inhales)
Monster: (roars)
Mother Olm: Hello young friends!
Mother Olm: I have some very important news. It's Andrias. We, Olms, can feel the tremors of his army's movement. That information about him moving out in a few days was a lie. He plans to invade Earth tonight.
Mother: It was a lovely performance. (gives Anne some coppers) Here!
Mr. Croaker: To Hop Pop and the Plantars, the most honest folks in the business.
Mr. Flour(from upstairs): Maddie, the buns are burning!
Mr. Flour(hugging the apron): Oh! My baby! My baby!
Mr. Flour(to the apron): It's okay, baby. Daddy's here.
Mr. Flour: (gasps) No, not my favorite apron.
Mr. Flour: (groans) I wrap my buguettes in that.
Mr. Flour: (groans) Oh. Here. (Hands over list.)
Mr. Flour: (grunts)
Mr. Flour: (grunts) Shell? What shell?
Mr. Flour: (nodding frantically) Uh-huh.
Mr. Flour: (not turning around) Morning, daughter.
Mr. Flour: (shudders) Baker's oath. Customer list, confidential.
Mr. Flour: Ain't she adorable?
Mr. Flour: Hey! That's my son-in-law!
Mr. Flour: If you want the dough, the boy has to marry my daughter.
Mr. Flour: Night girls!
Mr. Flour: Well, I think I saw your sisters with it.
Mr. Flour: Well, make sure you resurrect them when you're done.
Mr. Flour: Whoa!
Mr. Flour: Yay!
Mrs Croaker: Oh, great. Just what we need. Another outsider. (walks off)
Mrs. Boonchuy: No, sweetie, your California stomach can't handle it. But you can have carrot stick and trail mix. (Young Anne whimpers in sadness and we go back to the present.)
Mrs. Boonchuy: You know what Mommy really needs? You. Out of her kitchen. (speaks Thai) Txn ni! (Now!) (The flashback ends.)
Mrs. Croaker(pointing to Anne and Polly): Plenty of people don't like those two.
Mrs. Croaker:  Take one down Pass it around   No more jugs of juice On the wall 
Mrs. Croaker: (chuckles) Atta-kid.
Mrs. Croaker: (laughing)
Mrs. Croaker: (scoffs) Young love is the worst.
Mrs. Croaker: (screams)
Mrs. Croaker: (shouts)
Mrs. Croaker: (sighs) Okay, here's the plan. Loggle and Maddie, you're with me. Wally and Toadie, you're on offense. We keep the pressure on until Anne and Sasha are out with the goods. Now gear up. We leave in three!
Mrs. Croaker: A song! (vocalizing)  Ninety-nine jugs Of juice on the wall   Ninety-nine jugs of juice   Take one down, pass it around  (Back with Anne, she is still reading Bessie's History.)
Mrs. Croaker: Alastair's my man!
Mrs. Croaker: All right, boy. What's this all about? Spill it.
Mrs. Croaker: All right, you miserable layabouts, listen up.
Mrs. Croaker: And I just don't like you.
Mrs. Croaker: Archie! Sic 'em.
Mrs. Croaker: Archie?
Mrs. Croaker: Aw, crud.
Mrs. Croaker: Aw, shucks.
Mrs. Croaker: Back, back, you filthy vermin!
Mrs. Croaker: Barry? The candy man? You run the Marauders?
Mrs. Croaker: Been saving this gold farthing for a while now. Waiting for something special to spend it on. One bottle, please.
Mrs. Croaker: Bleh! Put your clothes back on, you pervert.
Mrs. Croaker: Bless my socks. If it isn't Sprig Plantar.
Mrs. Croaker: But you did go through all that trouble to get me to like you. I guess I can try and like you back.
Mrs. Croaker: Bye, darlin'. Next time, try to keep that road rage in check. (laughs) Yee-haw! (She whips her ladybug and it takes off at high speed. Mrs. Croaker's cackling is heard.) Woo-hoo!
Mrs. Croaker: Curse these old legs.
Mrs. Croaker: Don't worry, youngster. We won't let 'em get you.
Mrs. Croaker: Don't you wanna step out of your comfort zone, become something more than the vest-wearing pencil pusher you've always been?
Mrs. Croaker: Enough talk! Let her have it!
Mrs. Croaker: Everyone deserves a break, Loggle.
Mrs. Croaker: Here you go, deary. A hunk of cheese made fresh from the milk of those ca--
Mrs. Croaker: Hey!
Mrs. Croaker: Hey! Move your big behind, scarecrow. Croaker needs her cookies.
Mrs. Croaker: Hey, I know that irritating voice.
Mrs. Croaker: Hooligans! Ruffians! Swamp suckers!
Mrs. Croaker: Huh? What in tarnation? (She sees dust coming her way. Bessie rides past her very fast, causing her ladybug to spin out of control.) Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mrs. Croaker: I don't know. Something about your big eyes and goofy smile rub me the wrong way.
Mrs. Croaker: I have another question.
Mrs. Croaker: I'll take a bottle, Hopadiah.
Mrs. Croaker: I'll take the maggot larb. Did I say that right? Larb?
Mrs. Croaker: If you got a problem with her, you got a problem with all of us.
Mrs. Croaker: Jonah?
Mrs. Croaker: Just start the movie!
Mrs. Croaker: Listen, Toadie. The world has changed, and we've had to change with it.
Mrs. Croaker: Lookout! Again? Toadie, this is our team's sixth mission, and all you ever wanna do is organize the meetings and be the lookout!
Mrs. Croaker: Mayor Toadstool?
Mrs. Croaker: No-good son of a slug!
Mrs. Croaker: Not on my watch. Take that. And that!
Mrs. Croaker: Nothing happened. Nothing at all. Because if word of this gets out, let's just say it would be very bad for everyone. Are we clear?
Mrs. Croaker: Now, that was exciting.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, I like this Hopediah.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, absolutely.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, my pleasure, honey. Well, go on and get comfy. Watch out for ol' Archie, though. His venom can cause paralysis. Now hold on to your eyebrows. 'Cause here we go! (She whips her ladybug and whoops with joy.)
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, pishposh. Sadie Croaker never holds a grudge, honey.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, thank you, deary.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, those look fresh.
Mrs. Croaker: One more time! (Sprig covers his face with Archie and screams.)
Mrs. Croaker: One more, and one more. One more. Last one.
Mrs. Croaker: Ooh! Is it the Puzzle of the Month Club? (gasps) J-- Jonah?
Mrs. Croaker: Say, if we're all gonna be together anyway, why not bring all the gifts from our wish list?
Mrs. Croaker: Should we throw her in the deer prison?
Mrs. Croaker: Shut up and run!
Mrs. Croaker: Step aside, boy.
Mrs. Croaker: Thanks again for helping me out! I know Brutus can be a handful.
Mrs. Croaker: The Plantars are back! Get out here, everyone! It's the Plantars!
Mrs. Croaker: Upsy-daisy, Archie.
Mrs. Croaker: Usually, I find potions and the like to be a bunch of malarkey, but if Hopadiah Plantar says it works, then it must.
Mrs. Croaker: We need our stories!
Mrs. Croaker: Well, Hopadiah, looks like you're going to have to earn our trust back. That being said, I think your father would be proud that you did the right thing today.
Mrs. Croaker: Well, I think you're capable of so much more.
Mrs. Croaker: Well, hello, Anne. Polly.
Mrs. Croaker: Well, how about that? One foot in the grave and still learning new things.
Mrs. Croaker: What an idiot. What makes you think you can please everyone, kid? Jonah here don't like me.
Mrs. Croaker: What are you all looking at?
Mrs. Croaker: What are you doing here?
Mrs. Croaker: What did she just say?
Mrs. Croaker: What does Anne think?
Mrs. Croaker: What has gotten into you, Hopediah?
Mrs. Croaker: What?
Mrs. Croaker: What? That was the end?
Mrs. Croaker: What?!
Mrs. Croaker: Whew, good thing it's over. I don't even remember what we were fighting about.
Mrs. Croaker: Whoa, girl. Easy now. All right, everybody, we're home.
Mrs. Croaker: You don't say?
Mrs. Croaker: You know what would make this ride go a lot quicker?
Mrs. Croaker: You should have let sleeping frogs lie and stayed away. You'd have spared yourself from what's about to happen.
Mrs. Croaker: You're old!
Mrs. Croaker: You've made us all proud.
Mrs. Virk: Alright, class. Today's your lucky day cause it's Frog Dissection day.
Mrs. Virk: Oh, dear. Anne, why don't you take Sasha to the sick room before she desecrates these beautiful frog bodies with her vomit? Thank you.
Mud Man: Man, all I wanted to do today was get muddy and eat people.
Mud man: (grunts)
Mud man: Quickly, before she throws another one of those things!
Mud man: The jig is up, boys!
Narrator: In the not so distant future, three grounded yet supernatural teens must navigate their feelings if they hope to survive.
Narrator: Justice is watching you.
Narrator: Last week on Suspicion Island...
Narrator: Previously on Suspicion Island...
Narrator: Suspicion Island. If you don't stay suspicious, you won't stay alive.
Narrator: To be continued...
Narrator: Will these beautiful teens ever make it off the island? Find out next time on--
Nearby snake fly: (hisses)
News Reporter: Breaking news, 500 snakes have escaped from--Wait, is that a middle school student?
Newt: Oh it's on!
Okay, here's the plan:
Old Man: (picks up shirt) Ah, this is a good shirt.
Old frog: Huh? Ring the bell!
Old frog: What? Ring the bell?
Olivia: (sighs) Sleepover. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the kitchen drinking... juice.
Olivia: Ah, still fresh, I see. Excellent work. As expected of the great Marcy Wu. (snaps fingers)
Olivia: Dear King Andrias, just once, it would be nice if you followed proper castle etiquette.
Olivia: Do enjoy your stay.
Olivia: I see you have... company.
Olivia: It's a pleasure to meet you, Anne.
Olivia: May I present to you Andrias Leviathan, Lord of Amphibia. Peacekeeper of a thousand years and the first of his name.
Olivia: The king sends his greetings, Marcy. He trusts you have succeeded?
Olivia: Uh-huh.
Olivia: Yes, well, uh... Welcome to Newtopia, Plantars and Anne. This is an old city, but one rich in history and splendor. Please don't touch anything that looks important.
Outside: (cheering)
Patrick: Top of the mornin' to you, Sprig.
Peacock: *shrieks*
Pearl: Bye.
Pearl: Hello.
Pearl: Hey! (Anne gasps in surprise) Thank you for being so generous. Here. (hands Anne her butterfly broach) I'd be honored if you gave it to your mom. I'm no famous artist, but I made it myself and it's one-of-a-kind.
Pearl: Hey, Mom, how do you spell "winner"?
Percy (loudly): Sorry, guys. But this toad's gotta follow his dreams!
Percy, Braddock: (both scream)
Percy, Braddock: (both screaming)
Percy, Braddock: (both screaming, grunting)
Percy, Braddock: (both) Whoa!
Percy: "Okay"? Sasha, we almost died back there.
Percy: (gasps) I have?
Percy: (gulps) For Grime!
Percy: (sniffles) Captain Grime, sir, we're taking this tower back, even if we have to fight through 20 herons. Now come on, you toads. No one wants to live forever!
Percy: (whimpers)
Percy: Ah, man. That was my mom's boat.
Percy: Before we die, Braddock, I love you. I've always loved you.
Percy: Especially that Captain Beatrix! What's her problem?
Percy: Goodbye, Sash. We hope you pull it off. We really do.
Percy: Heroes?
Percy: Hey, I've been working on my act. Do you wanna see it?
Percy: Hey, Sasha. Brought you dinner. Cricket Thursdays.
Percy: No, Sasha, you did it. And I think me and Braddock are done with this. With all of it.
Percy: Okay, stay right there.
Percy: Ooh! That reminds me... I have one last touch for our outfits. Now we really are a team.
Percy: Sasha... please... stop this!
Percy: Ta-da!
Percy: Too soon?
Percy: Uh...That I quit and I've always hated this job. Bye!
Percy: Wait for me!
Percy: Yes, Commander?
Percy: You know what would lighten this atmosphere a little bit? A joke! How many herons does it take to storm a castle?
Percy: You know what? You're right. Thanks, Sasha. I can't wait to see the look on Grime's face when I tell him that I'm--
Peruvia: But, Randy, I think you're suspicious!
Peruvia: I've got a lot of feelings about this place.
Plantars: Cantaloupe! Cantaloupe!
Police chief: I don't care what it takes! Bring him to me, dead or alive!
Police officer: (chews donut)
Polly & Sprig: Hmm...
Polly (echoing): In your haaaands.
Polly (face covered): Couldn't tell you.
Polly (looking at Hop Pop): Huh?
Polly (narrating): Well, on our way back, Mrs. Croaker asked if we could pick her up a new romance novel while we were in the city.
Polly (sarcastic): Oh, no. What a surprise.
Polly (switches the spotlights to Grime): Aw, heck yeah!
Polly and Sprig: Aw, Hop Pop.
Polly and Sprig: Oh yeah!
Polly(reading a book entitled "Daggers and Where To Put Them"): Yes!
Polly, Sprig, Anne: (sigh)
Polly/Sprig: Ooh!
Polly: "Okay"? I've got a sword, baby! I'm doing better than all of you.
Polly: 'Sup.
Polly: (About to attack) Enough talk! (Just as she is about to hit Anne, she hits her.)
Polly: (As she pumps onto Sprig and wakes him up) First time I've ever seen you sleep in so late. What gives?
Polly: (Bursts past while shouting)
Polly: (bangs the door open and yells) Hey, family! What's happening in here?
Polly: (blows a raspberry) Jealous, I never get mail.
Polly: (chewing)
Polly: (chuckles) Frogs died here.
Polly: (chuckles) Says you.
Polly: (chuckles) You're a pawn.
Polly: (crying) And just when I was starting to like you!
Polly: (crying) Why, Sprig? I don't understand. Why?
Polly: (disappointed) Oh. Carry on.
Polly: (elbows him) Sprig!
Polly: (excited: gives a thumbs-up) Milk it!
Polly: (gasps) Boom shrooms?
Polly: (gasps) Candy from another world? Lady, you've got yourself a deal.
Polly: (gasps) Chocolate covered maggots! Come to Momma.
Polly: (gasps) How'd you know?
Polly: (gasps) I can't wait to abuse this power!
Polly: (gasps) It looks just like me.
Polly: (gasps) Me three!
Polly: (gasps) Mud Men!
Polly: (gasps) Oh.
Polly: (gasps) That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Polly: (gasps) They're cannibals.
Polly: (gasps) Wait. You don't mean...
Polly: (gasps, pops out of Anne's hair) I see it! I see it! I can see Wartwood!
Polly: (giggles)
Polly: (giggling)
Polly: (grabs the music box) Yoink. (screams)
Polly: (groans)
Polly: (groans) But why not?
Polly: (groans) Its eyes! They're watching me!
Polly: (groans) This is torture!
Polly: (growls) Enough! It's all your faults.
Polly: (grumbles)
Polly: (grunts) No, Polly. Resist. You go crawling back to Hop Pop now and you'll never be left on your own again. It'll be fine. You'll be fine.
Polly: (grunts) War cry!
Polly: (huffs)
Polly: (in slow motion) Sleepover.
Polly: (laughing)
Polly: (laughs nervously) All right, just a bowling ball, a mop, and other assorted items oddly arranged in the corner.
Polly: (laughs)
Polly: (laughs) After those wimpy deer cowards!
Polly: (laughs) Suckers!
Polly: (licking a fork) La-la-la-la.
Polly: (looking down from the top of the stairs) Will you two stop yelling? You know there's no soundproofing on these walls, right?
Polly: (loud burp)
Polly: (moans)
Polly: (monotone) Okay.
Polly: (munching)
Polly: (munching) What's that?
Polly: (screaming)
Polly: (screams)
Polly: (shakes Sprig) Pizza dreams!
Polly: (shouts) What kinda loser talk is that?
Polly: (shudders)
Polly: (sighs) (gasps) Hop Pop, look. There's another room connected to this one. Can I stay in here?
Polly: (sighs) Guess I should drag them inside. But first, I'm parched. (gulping) (exhales) (grunts) All right, Boulder-tron, you ready to roll?
Polly: (sighs) Say "home" again.
Polly: (spits) Know your place, plant!
Polly: (stunned)
Polly: (yells)
Polly: (yells) Why did they have to put the door on a stupid sunlight timer?
Polly: A report? Boo!
Polly: Aaah!
Polly: Aah!
Polly: Absolutely.
Polly: Actually proud to be a Plantar.
Polly: Agreed.
Polly: Ah! You're lucky you're an outsider, Anne. Our family history is weak!
Polly: Ah, come on!
Polly: Aha!
Polly: All right!
Polly: All right, time to get a move on, fam. (grunts)
Polly: All right.
Polly: And every year, the Townies destroy us! It's humiliating.
Polly: And how did you download him?
Polly: And on that note, I'm out.
Polly: And the winner is Hop Pop!
Polly: And they're here for our delicious souls!
Polly: And we just got the couch cleaned.
Polly: And while they're doing that, I'm gonna check out this scary forest.
Polly: Anne's gonna teach me some sweet moves. You guys wanna join?
Polly: Anne, what did you do?
Polly: Are you kidding? Sprig only went through with this because of you and this dumb magazine!
Polly: As long as I get to use my boom shrooms, I'm good.
Polly: Assassinating your critics, I love it.
Polly: Aw, how sweet. So where's Anne gonna sleep then? Not with me. My bucket's for one.
Polly: Aw, she's so tiny! I feel huge!
Polly: Aw.
Polly: Aw. Okay, let's finish this. (Spits and breaks record.)
Polly: Aw. Really glad I didn't push you off a cliff like I was planning.
Polly: Aw. Really thought that splash would be bigger. Hmm. (gasps)
Polly: Awesome!
Polly: Awww.
Polly: Blah! He thinks he's better than everyone else just 'cause he talks good.
Polly: Blegh!
Polly: Boo!
Polly: Brother...No...No!(crying)
Polly: But I'm not tired.
Polly: But imminent is the best kind of danger.
Polly: But the other kids did.
Polly: But why hasn't the door opened then?
Polly: By yourself?
Polly: Can we do something fun now?
Polly: Can we go home, Hop Papa? I'm so "sweeeepy."
Polly: Can we go off-road? (She pulls Hop Pop's eyelids.) Do some crazy stunts?
Polly: Can you imagine if Marcy got stuck with us instead of Anne? We'd be set for life!
Polly: Careful, girl!
Polly: Come on, Anne. Shake that man. Shake him.
Polly: Come on, let's just find another way out, you babies.
Polly: Cool!
Polly: Cool.
Polly: Couldn't buy much since we've barely got any money left.
Polly: Count me in. So what do we do?
Polly: Dang, girl!
Polly: Deal with it, lady. It's time to get dirty!
Polly: Death first!
Polly: Dibs on the crossbow.
Polly: Did you guys know that there are 60 weapons in the Morningstar family?
Polly: Didn't see a thing.
Polly: Do you have one we could buy?
Polly: Don't fall! I won't catch you!
Polly: Don't struggle, Anne.
Polly: Double check!
Polly: Dude, seriously, chill.
Polly: Dude... that was ice cold.
Polly: Eh, count me out.
Polly: Eh, he'll be fine.
Polly: Ew.
Polly: Ew. Gross, Anne.
Polly: Exactly! Maybe you ran down the phone so we'd have to listen to your boring play!
Polly: Family heirlooms!
Polly: Finally! Independence. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (laughs) Whoo! Yeah! (chuckles) Hyah! (sighs) Time to snuggle up in my own bed. (She turns off the light.)
Polly: For your guts!
Polly: Free candy! What's the catch?
Polly: Frog pile!
Polly: Get in here, you crazy kids.
Polly: Get used to this feeling.
Polly: Give me that.
Polly: Go, Anne!
Polly: Good luck getting rid of him now.
Polly: Good man, Boulder-tron. Good man.
Polly: Good night.
Polly: Good work, everyone! Wish I could help, but... no legs, you know?
Polly: Got it. Three, two, one.
Polly: Guys, look.
Polly: Ha ha! They have noses.
Polly: Ha. You? Good luck, Wallers. (Wally starts doing Muay Thai with Anne.) Huh?
Polly: Hag what?
Polly: Hah!
Polly: Hard pass, old man.
Polly: Here?
Polly: Hey! Did you hear me?
Polly: Hey! How about we solve the puzzle of getting the heck out of here!
Polly: Hey! Let me go.
Polly: Hey, I can fit under Bessie.
Polly: Hey, Sprig! Over here! I saved you a spot.
Polly: Hey, girlfriend! Huh, not here. Weird. Anne doesn't go anywhere without her phone. Well, let's go see what Sprig is up to.
Polly: Hey, guys. The failure arrow wants us to keep going this way.
Polly: Hey, shouldn't we get Marcy and Frobo in on this?
Polly: Hey, why do you think the entrance was hidden like that?
Polly: Hey-o! Where's the party at? Huh. Sprig's not here either. It's fine. Totally fine. They're probably just somewhere else. And now to calmly head back to my own room.
Polly: Hey. We gotta get out of here.
Polly: Hi-yah! (Anne dodges her and she goes through the bushes and hits Wally.)
Polly: Hiyah! (Disables machine)
Polly: Hmm, Polly likey.
Polly: Hmm.
Polly: Hmm...
Polly: Hmm...swell.
Polly: Ho...
Polly: Holy toot, another Anne!
Polly: Hop Pop!
Polly: Hop Pop! (groaning) This is the opposite of a suit of armor.
Polly: Hop Pop! I don't wanna be on my own. Sprig and Anne are missing and I'm scared. I don't wanna--
Polly: Hop Pop! You never let us have chocopede pancakes. What's going on?
Polly: Hop Pop, we broke a model ship. You crossed all kinds of ethical and moral lines!
Polly: Hop Pop.
Polly: Hot mama.
Polly: Hyah!
Polly: Hyah! Marinate this, you cannibals!
Polly: I ain't telling you nothing, old man.
Polly: I always tell them, "Save the heartfelt apologies for when we get to safety."
Polly: I can see your butt!
Polly: I can still smell that skunk juice. (shudders with Anne)
Polly: I do!
Polly: I don't know what it is, but I love it.
Polly: I don't see any--
Polly: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
Polly: I don't want your pity cookies.
Polly: I got a hatchet.
Polly: I guess it's possible.
Polly: I knew it! Enjoy being mush, you wax demon!
Polly: I know, right? Can we watch another one?
Polly: I like her.
Polly: I like steak.
Polly: I love it! Hey, sorry, girl time was such a bust.
Polly: I love this guy!
Polly: I love this part!
Polly: I needed to pee! Plus, if you heard me, you were awake too. You're the suspicious one!
Polly: I still think we should just give them time. Not like we have a lot of options. You can't force people to get along.
Polly: I wanna be the maid of honor!
Polly: I would like to get off the ride now!
Polly: I would never stab Chad in the back, but one of you two would.
Polly: I'll bite your face off!
Polly: I'll leave the door open. And I'll go straight to bed. Pretty, pretty please?
Polly: I'll tell you who she picks! Hunter! He's a beefcake.
Polly: I'm eating your pancakes!
Polly: I'm hungry just thinking about it.
Polly: I'm just kidding, Wally. Get in there.
Polly: I'm so sorry, you guys. Please don't get mad.
Polly: I'm tired of facing my fears, Anne.
Polly: I've always been more of a waffle girl, myself.
Polly: If you don't wanna cough up your organs, stay back!
Polly: Is that the best you got?
Polly: It all leads up to a big ceremony where the grubhog pops out of his official stump!
Polly: It was an honest mistake, Sprig.
Polly: It's a trap!
Polly: Jumpy little fella.
Polly: Just give me an excuse to use old Doris here.
Polly: Just go already!
Polly: Just look at them.
Polly: Less talky-talky, more runny-runny!
Polly: Let the final challenge begin!
Polly: Let's do it!
Polly: Let's do this.
Polly: Let's just say he got hungry. And he ate it.
Polly: Listen up! I don't even want to live in a town with someone who likes Alastair.
Polly: Little on the nose, but okay.
Polly: May I have this dance, madame?
Polly: Maybe I can smash it. Hiyah! Well, that didn't work.
Polly: Me and Hop Pop forgot the wish list and didn't get you guys anything!
Polly: Me! Out of the way, you plebes.
Polly: Milk that credit card!
Polly: Miracles happen!
Polly: Mission accomplished.
Polly: Mmm! Pillbug pancakes.
Polly: Monroe wins at pretty much everything. Lawn bowling, shuffleboard, other old man activities.
Polly: More or less.
Polly: My interest has been restored.
Polly: Never happening.
Polly: Never mind that. Let's get that ruby!
Polly: No fair. You have appendages.
Polly: No offense, but I'm not sure you could handle it.
Polly: No!
Polly: No, me! No, me!
Polly: No, no. Wait. No! I'll just get dirty again. You can't stop me! I learned this from watching you, Anne!
Polly: No, we're not!
Polly: Nope, just our Hop Pop bein' a freak.
Polly: Nope. No crimes committed.
Polly: Not me. I'm here for the drama.
Polly: Not to me!
Polly: Not you. Frownzilla over there.
Polly: Now that you mention it...
Polly: Oh no, Sprig! We're right smack dab in the middle of the love-nado! Maybe we should've listened to the end of Soggy Joe's thing.
Polly: Oh oh oh!
Polly: Oh! (gasps)
Polly: Oh, Sprig, good. You survived.
Polly: Oh, and look at Hop Pop trying to Randy his way out of this.
Polly: Oh, boy.
Polly: Oh, come on!
Polly: Oh, come on! Don't worry, Marcy. We don't have to go into the boring old-
Polly: Oh, cool, our lantern.
Polly: Oh, hi, Sprig.
Polly: Oh, in that case, take the deal.
Polly: Oh, no!
Polly: Oh, no, you don't! You were trying to Chad her into trusting you!
Polly: Oh, that makes sense.
Polly: Oh, wow. Can you believe it? Another mysterious hidden chamber.
Polly: Oh, yeah, yeah. Right.
Polly: Oh.
Polly: Oh. Hey, Anne.
Polly: Ohhh!
Polly: Okay, it's a little creepy, but nothing I can't handle--(squeaks)
Polly: Okay, just most of the time.
Polly: Okay, we're done here.
Polly: Okay.
Polly: On a mission!
Polly: Ooh! I wanna riot too!
Polly: Ooh, what are these?
Polly: Or dead bodies! Let's do it!
Polly: Our ancestors were boring!
Polly: Our ancestors were the most amazing scientist, warrior, farmers ever!
Polly: Ow.
Polly: Ow. Wha... How did you...
Polly: Perfect. Now that the nerds are gone, you guys want to go make mischief? Guys?
Polly: Phew.
Polly: Polly.
Polly: Pretty impressive, Anne.
Polly: Probably a bad time to bring this up, but I still get the candy, right?
Polly: Rich people are messed up.
Polly: Right on! Let's motor, bro-bro!
Polly: Rise and shine, fam. (She smacks each of them.)
Polly: Run, run, run!
Polly: Say what?
Polly: Score!
Polly: Secret rooms!
Polly: Shake that booty!
Polly: She was the coolest, most terrifying Plantar ever. Like me!
Polly: She's frozen!
Polly: Sights!
Polly: So no one wants to cause trouble with me?
Polly: So shiny. So sparkly. *screams*
Polly: So you dragged us to this horror show for no reason? Twisted. I love it.
Polly: So, older brother, you here to finally admit I'm right and surrender to the...Hunter tribe?
Polly: So, uh, remember when Hop Pop and I went to pick up the Fwagon?
Polly: So, what's the next lesson?
Polly: So, you experiment with other weapons or are you just a spear guy?
Polly: So, you guys wanna do it again?
Polly: Some of us are (screaming) trying to sleep!
Polly: Somebody get him!
Polly: Speak for yourself.
Polly: Speaking of temples, I think you way overhyped this place.
Polly: Sprig! Wait! No!
Polly: Sprig! You broke the house.
Polly: Sprig, look! Soggy Joe was right. There's a burrow off to the side. Come on!
Polly: Sprig, you can't manipulate people like this!
Polly: Still no.
Polly: Stop staring at me!
Polly: Stop this madness!
Polly: Stupid sleep! I wanna watch it right now!
Polly: Super wrong?
Polly: Take me to my bucket.
Polly: Tell me that thing is gone!
Polly: Ten bucks says he doesn't come back up.
Polly: Thanks, Hop Pop. But I was actually hoping to sleep in your room tonight. Being on my own was kinda freaky.
Polly: Thanks, Wally.
Polly: That does it! Everybody who chooses Hunter, get behind me!
Polly: That doesn't make any sense!
Polly: That seat is mine!
Polly: That was amazing!
Polly: That was awesome, you guys!
Polly: That was the day I realized you weren't going to eat us!
Polly: That was the saddest thing I've ever seen. And I've seen some things.
Polly: That's horrible!
Polly: That's my family!
Polly: That's what I'm talkin' about!
Polly: The future is ours.
Polly: The old man's a lying snake, but he does have a point.
Polly: Then perish!
Polly: There was a bathroom. That also means there were--
Polly: There's only one way to find out. (groans)
Polly: They are!
Polly: They're gonna eat each other alive.
Polly: They're just getting used to each other. It's not a big deal.
Polly: This abomination must be destroyed.
Polly: This guy's awesome!
Polly: This is deranged!
Polly: This is heaven. (gasps) This is the same Polliana from Hop Pop's shrub. She wasn't just a turnip farmer. She was a turnt up warrior!
Polly: This is impossible! I'll learn how to fly before I learn...
Polly: This is so great! Our first day in forever with no responsibilities! So, what are we gonna do?
Polly: This is so not fair. I want my own room!
Polly: This is worse.
Polly: This means war!
Polly: Those big eyes and goofy grin are hard to resist.
Polly: To the VIP seats!
Polly: Traitor!
Polly: True that.
Polly: Uh, I think this place is closed! So let's leave and never come back!!
Polly: Uh, can we please fix the giant hole in the house?
Polly: Uh, counterpoint. Why don't we just leave them alone?
Polly: Uh, guys? A little help here.
Polly: Uh, guys? I think we have a situation.
Polly: Uh, me too. I need to get off now or I'll explode! (The other passengers gasp.)
Polly: Uh, reading time.
Polly: Uh-oh.
Polly: Uh...
Polly: Uh...guys?
Polly: Understatement!
Polly: WHY ARE WE YELLING!!??!!
Polly: Wait! Sprig, no!
Polly: Wait, that's not in the book.
Polly: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What about... Hop Pop?
Polly: Wait, what?
Polly: Wait...Something's off.
Polly: Want me to grab a weapon or two from the hidden armory under the house?
Polly: We all voted last week. Don't you remember?
Polly: We can do anything!
Polly: We couldn't wait. So we took the pipes too.
Polly: We have to work together!
Polly: We need the supplies to survive through the night.
Polly: We respect nothing!
Polly: We were all thinking it!
Polly: We're Muay Thai-ing!
Polly: We're sorry, Hop Pop. This is yours, by the way.
Polly: Weapon check here! Weapon check. Leave a weapon, take a number.
Polly: Weapon! Take a weapon, leave a body.
Polly: Weapons?
Polly: Welcome to Grubhog Day, Anne! It's the one day a year that no one works and the whole swamp cuts loose.
Polly: Well don't give the temple a chance to change it's mind. Charge that bad boy!
Polly: Well, actually, I have a tail but I see what you're doing.
Polly: Well, at least this guy doesn't waste my time with stuff I think is stupid and boring!
Polly: Well, guess we're dead.
Polly: Well, that's not good.
Polly: Well, they're broken.
Polly: Well, this is a bummer.
Polly: Welp, we're lost. Probably gonna be stuck here forever.
Polly: Welp. Time to turn back. Thanks for playing, everyone!
Polly: What are we looking at here?
Polly: What are you even saying?
Polly: What do we do, Marcy? This is fun to watch and all, but it could make the last puzzle pretty rough.
Polly: What gives, Loggle?
Polly: What's that?
Polly: What's up?
Polly: What's your problem?
Polly: What?
Polly: What? Aw, Hop Pop!
Polly: What? I hardly know her.
Polly: What? This ain't even enough for a candy bar.
Polly: Where will you go?
Polly: Who would dig a bunch of holes in the ground?
Polly: Who?
Polly: Whoa! (laughs) Whoo! (laughs) Higher!
Polly: Whoa! Abandon ship!
Polly: Whoa, mama.
Polly: Whoo! Yeah! Thanks, Hop Pop. You're the best.
Polly: Whoo! Yeah, Croaker! Mess him up.
Polly: Whoo-hoo!
Polly: Whoo-hoo! Me and Sprig's first sleepover.
Polly: Why would this be painless?
Polly: Why you screaming?
Polly: Wimpy little frogs covered in mud.
Polly: With my life, actually.
Polly: With spikes in it!
Polly: Woo!
Polly: Wow! Flying? What a great way to spy on my enemies. (evil laugh)
Polly: Wow, Anne, you weren't kidding about her being in the zone.
Polly: Wow, Sprig, I owe you an apology. Your dumb ol' plan actually kinda worked.
Polly: Wow.
Polly: Ya think?
Polly: Yah! Yah yah yah yah yah! And that! And that! Hi-yah!
Polly: Yeah!
Polly: Yeah! I still think you're pretty smart. A little obsessive, though.
Polly: Yeah! I wasn't worried.
Polly: Yeah! Whoo!
Polly: Yeah! You gotta get out there and bring Anne back!
Polly: Yeah, actually, it turned out they were just frogs.
Polly: Yeah, it even smells real.
Polly: Yeah, it'll be nice to sit this one out cause these flippas be tired. (screams)
Polly: Yeah, probably.
Polly: Yeah, so am I.
Polly: Yeah, that pumpkin will squash you.
Polly: Yeah, they were pretty cool. Now, can we finally find a way out of here?
Polly: Yeah, this ain't happening.
Polly: Yeah, this is uncomfortable to watch.
Polly: Yeah, this thing is pretty played out.
Polly: Yeah, where's old "teachers stink" Anne?
Polly: Yeah, yeah. Hey Anne, anything else on that list?
Polly: Yeah. A crazy person.
Polly: Yeah. Could Tritonio be using us?
Polly: Yeah. Hand it over.
Polly: Yeah. I guess it's just kinda hard to spit when you feel gross.
Polly: Yeah. The monster fights are pretty cool, though.
Polly: Yep, he's always been something of a town favorite.
Polly: Yes. Very odd.
Polly: Yoo-hoo!
Polly: You callin' me a Vivica?
Polly: You can do that? Oh, these newts aren't gonna know what hit 'em. (hops away laughing)
Polly: You go, girls.
Polly: You got it!
Polly: You got it, chief.
Polly: You gotta stop popping out of bushes, Soggy Joe.
Polly: You guys done moping? 'Cause Frobes and I charge by the hour.
Polly: You know, I'm not really tired. I should go see what Anne and Sprig are up to.
Polly: You know, it's been a long time since you and I had a solo adventure.
Polly: You let my family go!
Polly: You need to stop.
Polly: You people and your legs.
Polly: You read my mind.
Polly: You saying you were wrong?
Polly: You stole the corn, didn't you?
Polly: You two are responsible for me, huh? So I guess that means that you're responsible for this!
Polly: You want me to...(clicks tongue) off Toadie? I'll do it. You know I will.
Polly: You'll never take me alive!
Polly: You're a good older brother, Sprig.
Polly: You're always wrong?
Polly: You're bald!
Polly: You're mad!
Polly: You're not gonna eat us, are you? You're not even gonna try. Dis... appointing.
Polly: You're right. I am just a little tadpole, and I'm not ready to be alone!
Polly: You've lost your mind!
Polly: You. You. Uh-uh! Not you.
Polly: Zip it! The only reason we're here marinating is because you all had to play matchmaker. You two were greedy, plain and simple.
Priscilla: (scoffs) That's what you think.
Priscilla: And that teapot is mine.
Priscilla: Don't be a stranger, Anne.
Priscilla: Hey, Mop Top. Congratulations. You won fair and square.
Priscilla: Just make sure you take care of that thing, okay? The newt who made it was special. One-of-a-kind.
Priscilla: Just put your name, sweetie.
Priscilla: N... (sighs) Thank you. This means so much to us. You're not half bad, Mop Top.
Priscilla: Name's Priscilla the Killa. Champion of the Smash and Mash Derby, 20 years running. This is my daughter Pearl.
Priscilla: No, I couldn't.
Priscilla: Yeah, the kind who encouraged you to follow your dreams, even if they were wacky and dangerous. (chuckles) The kind who cut the crust off your sandwiches 'cause she knew you didn't like 'em. That teapot was the last piece of art she ever made. So like I said, take care of it.
Priscilla: Yeah.
Pumpkin Monster: (breathing heavily)
Pumpkin Monster: (furious roaring)
Pumpkin Monster: (growling)
Pumpkin Monster: (growls)
Pumpkin Monster: (low growl)
Pumpkin Monster: (screeching)
Pumpkin Monster: (sighs)
Pumpkin Monster: chuckles
Purple Newt Soldier: Come on toad. Figure it out.
Purple Newt Soldier: Way to leave your armor on, you dumb toad.
Random Citizen: Oh, my frog. It's the wheel of fun.
Random frog: (burps)
Randy: I feel like everyone on this island is suspicious, Peruvia, except you!
Randy: Nooooooo!!!
Rosemary and Lavender: Yeah!
Rosemary, Lavender and Ginger: Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Maddie!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (cackles)
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (groans)
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: (innocent eyes) Good night, daddy.
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Aah!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Aww.
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Hide and seek!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Juggle us! Juggle us!
Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger: Yay!
Rosemary: Hey, sis! You promise you play with us, remember?
Rosemary: I can't believe it! Maddie replaced us?
Rosemary: Remember when you used to juggle us?
Rosemary: So, here we are!
Rosemary: That's it! That's it! That's it! We just have to use one of Maddie's witchy spells to grow up!
Rosemary: We were just trying to play with you.
Rosemary: What happened to a few minutes?
Rosemary: Won't be babies for much longer.
Salesman: Socks, buttons. Don't know why you'd want them but we got 'em!
Saleswoman: (snoring)
Sand liger: (roars)
Sasha (thinking): I think I can live with that.
Sasha (to herself): Hold on for a little longer, girls. I'm coming for you. And when I find you, we're gonna get home. But first, I think we're gonna have some fun with this place.
Sasha (whispering): Come back. Get back here.
Sasha Singing: I'm a heart stomper! Stompin' on hearts! If you wanna get away, you're gonna need a head start!
Sasha: (With an annoyed expression on her face) For sure. Teach it to us, Anne.
Sasha: (chuckles) Come on, Anne. It hasn't even been 30 minutes. Give it a little more time.
Sasha: (gasps)
Sasha: (gasps) Anne! (screams)
Sasha: (gasps, grunts)
Sasha: (giggles) I'll fill you in later. For now, I'm just glad I found you. We came as soon as we heard.
Sasha: (groans)
Sasha: (groans) Get croaked!
Sasha: (grunts) I think I've had enough of you, squeaky toy. (grunts)
Sasha: (in a sarcastic tone) And how about we shoot you out of a cannon?
Sasha: (laughs) Cancel the red alert. Seriously, we're not here to fight.
Sasha: (laughs) Hey, Marmar! Whoa! Check out your new threads!
Sasha: (laughs) Not possible.
Sasha: (laughs) Okay.
Sasha: (offscreen) There we go. That's my girl.
Sasha: (puts up her hand) Anne, this isn't cute anymore. We are meeting up with Marcy right now. End of discussion.
Sasha: (rolls her eyes) Good Lord!
Sasha: (sighs) Anne, Anne, Anne. Very disappointing. Now let's move. Grime's waiting for us.
Sasha: (sighs) Forget the sick room. Forget school. Let's get out of here and celebrate your birthday in style.
Sasha: (sighs) Listen, twerp and twerpette, you're not here to pass notes and play footsie. You're here to do a job. And these pairings are super important to the mission.
Sasha: (sighs) So now, once again, I'm forcing you to do things my way. You know what, maybe I should just leave and join a different band.
Sasha: (slurps) Oh, she's totally freaking out.
Sasha: (strains) I can't! I've lost control of it!
Sasha: (unimpressed) Does it?
Sasha: A basement? Yuck. Follow me. I'm gonna show you something crazy.
Sasha: A bird? You guys are scared of a bird?
Sasha: A dope axe-beetle from Toad Tower. Check this out.
Sasha: A gang of dirty, anarchist frogs who don't work for Andrias or the rebellion. They hijack caravans, raid villages for scraps and are basically a huge, unwashed thorn in my side.
Sasha: Absolutely not.
Sasha: Ah, he's not so bad once you get used to him. Now hurry up, nerds.
Sasha: All of Andrias' power comes from this music box. So our best bet is to get it away from him.
Sasha: All right, now we've got its attention. Get ready. Three, two, one, now!
Sasha: All right, there's our target. And our supplier is just on the other side of the pass. I'll keep watch up here, and signal him when the cannon is down.
Sasha: All right. Let's take five. Grimesy, a word in private, please?
Sasha: Alright, then let's draw this game plan up and-
Sasha: And Percy?
Sasha: And what were those nice things you said about Gary?
Sasha: And you came up with this together. (smiling) I thought you hated each other.
Sasha: Anne, it isn't like that.
Sasha: Anne, this is your 13th birthday. You only get one of these. So let's make it the best birthday in the history of birthdays.
Sasha: Anne, this isn't working. We need to do something.
Sasha: Anne, what are you doing!?!
Sasha: Anne, what are you doing? Are you really gonna risk your life for these talking frogs? We don't even belong here. Don't you wanna get back home? See your family?
Sasha: Anne?!
Sasha: Are you sure about that? You're not exactly Mr. Popular around here.
Sasha: Aw, come here.
Sasha: Aww, Boonchuy. You did all you could. Now buck up, soldier. We'll figure out a new plan.
Sasha: Beatrix! Tritonio! Welcome!
Sasha: Bingo.
Sasha: Boom! I knew you'd change your mind.
Sasha: Braddock! Hey, girlfriend. How's the garden coming along?
Sasha: Bring it on, birdbrain!
Sasha: Bring us the usual.
Sasha: But being in charge means making tough calls. And sometimes you have to stop and remember to have faith in the people around you. You taught me that.
Sasha: But we're almost there!
Sasha: But-
Sasha: Buzzkill.
Sasha: Caught these prisoners trying to escape, Grime.
Sasha: Cheerleading, believe it or not.
Sasha: Chill out, Anne. They're with me.
Sasha: Come on, come on.
Sasha: Come on, don't just agree with everything I say. What's your actual opinion?
Sasha: Cool. Well, have fun out there.
Sasha: Croaker, you and your team come up with the battle strategy. Me and Anne are gonna go grab the gear.
Sasha: Cute.
Sasha: Dang, Anne! You were a total boss out there.
Sasha: Doesn't matter. Word has traveled like wildfire, and we've got to make an example out of him. (takes Anne over to a window) So, the toads are just gonna feed him to that thing.
Sasha: Don't worry. I'll still be rooting for you guys. This is just how I go sometimes. I'll see you tonight.
Sasha: Don't worry. Leave this to us.
Sasha: Eat this!
Sasha: Eh, that'll take too long. Besides, this temple's been pretty direct so far.
Sasha: Enough loser talk. We can do this. Just remember what we practiced and keep your eye on the prize.
Sasha: Enough!
Sasha: Family party, right? Lame. Let me guess, a clown? With balloon animals?
Sasha: Get out of my way, Grime.
Sasha: Get your own food, you dumb bug.
Sasha: Good morning, everyone. Wait. Is it morning? It's hard to tell underground. Whatever. We've got good news and bad news.
Sasha: Goodbye, Percy. Goodbye, Braddock.
Sasha: Gotta twirl, Grimesy.
Sasha: Great! Done! You'll have it in your Crypt-keeper hands by morning.
Sasha: Great, these lyrics are all over the place totally. They'll have to change. Uh, are these bug suits? Oh, no, no, no. Mar-mar, the drumming is a little to dense. Let's strip some of these down. And you, we definitely need more lights. (Dumps mushrooms on Polly until she's buried) Frobo, too much fog, yet not enough fog. You feel me? Boom! Fixed it.
Sasha: Grime-sy! How would you like to be in a band with me?
Sasha: Guys, we need to work together if we're gonna stop Andrias. Let's just head down to the war room and talk through some strategies.
Sasha: Ha! (groans) Whoa!
Sasha: Ha! This is all me!
Sasha: Here, I'll give you a head start. Whoa, Grime! So you think your guards are all amazing but you're afraid to tell them your true feelings?
Sasha: Hey Grime-sy. I'm gonna go rehearse with the girls. You all right going solo?
Sasha: Hey there, Grimesy! What's that, like, the fifth toad I've talked into leaving this week?
Sasha: Hey! Ugly chicken! (grunts)
Sasha: Hey, Anne?
Sasha: Hey, Margot! Leave her alone! Also, nice guitar solo, Vince.
Sasha: Hey, girlfriend! Good to see you!
Sasha: Hey, my pleasure. And don't forget, just strike a pose and we'll leave.
Sasha: Hey.
Sasha: Huh. Well, thanks for that perspective, you weird, little butler frog. Now, come on. We've got a lot of practicing to do if we're gonna win. A one, and a two, and a 20 times through!
Sasha: Huh?
Sasha: Humans. We're called humans.
Sasha: I don't believe this. You're telling me we spent all this time building this giant army and there's a chance you guys won't work together?
Sasha: I know, right? (sighs) And once this is over, we can finally find a way out of this crummy, gross world.
Sasha: I know.
Sasha: I think that's... perfect! It's just like the plan from that movie.
Sasha: I'm bringing two teams of two. One for the shield generator, one to take out the cannon before the five minutes are up. Stumpy, Fern, Ivy, and Sprig, follow me.
Sasha: I'm gonna give Anne a quick tour. Escort these frogs to the banquet hall.
Sasha: I'm not confident that would succeed. Andrias' security is top notch and I don't think orphans are gonna trick a bunch of soulless robots.
Sasha: I- I'd like that.
Sasha: I... (gets very confused) whaaaat?
Sasha: It means you three are going to slow us down. Go wait outside until we're done.
Sasha: It's good. I just have a few tiny notes that I think could make it even better.
Sasha: It's okay, but believe me, I do care about these frogs. A lot. We've been through some serious stuff together when you were gone.
Sasha: It's over. We can't do this.
Sasha: Just wait. Croaker's team is pretty tough. There's a chance they'll escape on their own.
Sasha: Listen here, you buffoon! What's it gonna take to prove than you should follow us?
Sasha: Listen if I leave, you guys can have all the fun you want. I can have all the control I want. And we can all get what we want.
Sasha: Listen up! Our spies tell us that Andrias plans to invade Earth in just a few days. So it's time for our rebellion to mobilize!
Sasha: Listen up, soldiers. The Marauders have intercepted our latest shipment of weapons.
Sasha: Look, Anne, I'm telling you, we just have to wait.
Sasha: Looks like I'm a solo act, unless I can find someone who wants to do everything I say.
Sasha: Maybe you're better off without me.
Sasha: Me too! Sorry it took so long.
Sasha: Mmm-hmm. (gasps)
Sasha: Nah, I've seen their performance, and it's all right. But nowhere near as good as it could've been with me in control. I just wanted all of us to succeed. I was just being a good friend. Why couldn't they see that?
Sasha: Nice one, Perce! Now, come on everyone. Let's get out there and impress some toads... or we die!
Sasha: No problem.
Sasha: No way! Is your real name...
Sasha: No way! You mean we can almost go home?
Sasha: No worries. You just gotta speak their language. But never mind that. Happy birthday, girl!!
Sasha: No! I can do this! I am not gonna fail! Not while Anne and Marcy are getting by without me!
Sasha: Nope. The whole reason we were stalking you was... so I could tell Anne that everything that happened at Toad Tower was my fault.
Sasha: Not bad. What if the bridge was an F-sharp instead of C-sharp?
Sasha: Not exactly. Just try saying nice things for a change. Get them to love you, and they'll do anything for you.
Sasha: Not gonna happen.
Sasha: Now, strike the final pose!
Sasha: Of course! Trust Marcy to already have a plan!
Sasha: Of course, I don't mind. The more, the merrier.
Sasha: Of course, I haven't forgotten. And I'm pretty sure they bought my act back there. Hook, line, and sinker.
Sasha: Of course, we did. After all, we're the best team in this or any other world. Right, Braddock? Percy?
Sasha: Oh my gosh. Anne, this is a total disaster.
Sasha: Oh yeah. By pointing out they both value proper lung control.
Sasha: Oh, I understand, Anne. You're a good little girl who's gotta go home to her mommy and daddy. Come on. Hang out with your friends that love you.
Sasha: Oh, Percy!
Sasha: Oh, and maybe at the end, we could do the splits.
Sasha: Oh, crud!
Sasha: Oh, hey guys, those costumes are... something else.
Sasha: Oh, it works, all right. Trust me.
Sasha: Oh, my gosh. Marcy says she found the perfect gift for you downtown. (laughs) A frog music box for the frog lover. I wonder if those gems are real. (pushes Anne) Come on. Let's keep this party train rollin'. Choo-choo!
Sasha: Oh, please. I've been watching you the whole time. You don't trust me at all.
Sasha: Oh, the rebellion.
Sasha: Oh. (laughs) Thanks, Grime-sy. What can I say? Just how I do. Up top.
Sasha: Okay, fine. It was just a suggestion. Now, come on. Let's move.
Sasha: Okay, here's the thing. I struck a deal with Grime. I'd help him capture Hop Pop and crush the rebellion, and Grime and his army will help us find a way home. The whole banquet trick-- My idea, obvi. Now we've got those slimy frogs right where we want them. Isn't this great?
Sasha: Okay, if you keep yelling at them like that, they'll keep being useless, and we'll all die.
Sasha: Okay, listen up. If I help you get rid of these birds, you will give me provisions and release me. Deal?
Sasha: Okay, so the teams are, Sprig with Stumpy, and Ivy with Fern.
Sasha: One Warhammer as promised.
Sasha: Or else you can forget coming to my awesome house party next week. It'll be really sad when the whole class is enjoying the pool without you.
Sasha: Or?
Sasha: Out of the way, Granny!
Sasha: Percy!
Sasha: Psst, Anne, you're with me.
Sasha: Psst. Drop the mic.
Sasha: Relax, we're not invading anything. Come on, Anne. You too, frogs. We don't want to keep Grime waiting.
Sasha: Right, right, you got it. Now let's get this thing started!
Sasha: Right? Let's get outta here. (heaving) Mrs. Virk, the sight of blood... I-- I'm gonna be sick.
Sasha: Run the hot water, please. For the shower.
Sasha: Sent me? No one. How'd I get here? Don't know. What do I want? To find my friends and go home. Haven't we been through this enough?
Sasha: Shh. I'm trying to get us home.
Sasha: Simple. We heard you two were traveling together and tracked you both here.
Sasha: So you've probably already noticed that the toads in this valley have one job: to rule over the frogs. And lately, those frogs have been stepping outta line. It turns out these "rebels" have been inspired by a certain frog. You might just know him. Stood up to some tax collectors, even ran for mayor against the local toad.
Sasha: So, here we are.
Sasha: So, we're gonna sneak into their camp and steal our stuff back.
Sasha: So, what's this hammer, and why are y'all so scared of it?
Sasha: Sorry, cheerleading muscle memory. Here's a watch for each of you. The shift change is about to start. Follow my plan exactly and it should just be enough. Okay, team, move out!
Sasha: Stay back, everyone. I got this.
Sasha: Take it, Toadie!
Sasha: Thanks for all of that stuff back there. Believing in me and junk.
Sasha: Thanks, I get it.
Sasha: That's because we can't risk...
Sasha: That's called collaboration, Anne.
Sasha: That's not true. Besides, we did it.
Sasha: That's our cue. Come on. It's go time.
Sasha: The Warhammer. It's the only weapon big enough to dent this thing's armor.
Sasha: The cannon is protected by a force field. If we can take that out, we can destroy the weapon. There's a robot battalion protecting both structures. But every hour, there's a five-minute window where the robots change shifts. That's our chance to strike.
Sasha: Then it's a good thing I showed up.
Sasha: Then put your sword down now. End of discussion.
Sasha: There's no time! Follow me!
Sasha: There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
Sasha: They're just slimy little frogs, Anne! They don't matter!
Sasha: This is where I've been living.
Sasha: This thing's gonna be over before it starts. Let's get going, nerds.
Sasha: This thing's never coming loose!
Sasha: Totally! Bring it.
Sasha: Uh, so, what do you say, Wartwood? You ready to party back at the tower?
Sasha: Uh-huh, yeah, okay. Anyways, I upheld my part of the deal. So give me some rations, a map, maybe a cool cloak or two, and I'll be on my way.
Sasha: Wait, other humans? They must be talking about Anne and Marcy. I don't believe it. They're working together? Without me?
Sasha: We had to go into hiding and I had a lot of time to think about things. But (chuckles) what are you guys doing in a honkin' volcano?
Sasha: We might just get captured ourselves, and the resistance can't lose both its leaders.
Sasha: We should definitely play my song "Heart Stomper." It was always a hit back home.
Sasha: We used to slay at talent shows.
Sasha: We'll train.
Sasha: Wha...
Sasha: What are you doing here?
Sasha: What are you laughing at?
Sasha: What do you mean by that?
Sasha: What the heck's wrong with you? You know this isn't a real battle, right?
Sasha: What the heck?!
Sasha: What's gotten into you, Anne? You were never like this back home!
Sasha: What's it look like?! I'm getting the Warhammer back to the tower!
Sasha: What's that? You think Braddock is the toughest toad in the tower 'cause she doesn't take garbage from anyone?
Sasha: What? How can you believe in me after I was such a jerk to you?
Sasha: What? How do you even live like that? I have opinions about everything. And if I'm not in control at all times, I'll go crazy. It's actually kind of exhausting.
Sasha: What? Where are you going? Guys, come back. You're not actually gonna throw this all away, are you? We are so close. I can feel it.
Sasha: What? Why? 'Cause we invaded the town?
Sasha: Whoa!
Sasha: Whoa, this is serious.
Sasha: Whoa, you guys okay?
Sasha: Whoo! All aboard the party barge!
Sasha: Whoo! Here we go.
Sasha: Whoo! Wow! Get it, toad! That was legit, Percy. Honestly, you're wasting your time here as a guard.
Sasha: Yeah, unbelievable. Especially since you still don't trust me. Even after I apologized.
Sasha: Yeah. What's the problem?
Sasha: Yes!
Sasha: Yes! Play that drum! Blow the horn!
Sasha: Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Sasha: Yo, Brunton. (snaps fingers)
Sasha: You better be right. We don't have much time and a lot is riding on this.
Sasha: You certainly seem close with those three. What happened to, "Ew, frogs are the worst"?
Sasha: You don't know about the rebellion? Look, I'll explain. Just promise not to freak out or anything.
Sasha: You heard the lady. Let's move out!
Sasha: You know, as much as it pains me to lose, it was worth it have so much fun with you guys up there.
Sasha: You warty little--
Sasha: You're Hop Pop? Thought you'd be taller.
Sasha: You're right! (groans) I'll never give up. Not today, not ever!
Sasha: You, tiny sad frog. You're coming with me.
Sasha: Yup. It was wrong of me to put your frog friends in danger. And doubly wrong of me to push you around.
Sasha: Yup. Just me and some friends of mine.
Server: Now, who should I give the bill to? (glances at Anne) Probably not you.
Server: Right you are.
Sewer Gator: Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Sheep: *bleats*
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Afternoon, Tuti. Wonderin' if you've seen a couple of ol' scammers handing out these fake IOUs today.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Fiery as ever, Tuti.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Less like sittin' and more like gatherin' eggs for the town until your debt's paid off.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Now pay up, or I'm gonna have to do my duty, and put y'all in debtor's prison.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Okay, little lady. You get three official chances. You ready?
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Only one more chance, little lady.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Sorry, little lady, but Hopadiah's broke. Which makes these IOUs you've been handing out totally worthless. (Steps aside to reveal Sprig and Hop Pop with handcuffs)
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Twenty four karat, ma'am.
Sheriff Buck Leatherleaf: Well, your debt is repaid and my work here is done.
Soggy Joe: (Bursts up) Just like us! (laughs) Ah, yes. The Mud Men only fear two things. Daylight and being clean. Holy honey thistle!
Soggy Joe: (groans)
Soggy Joe: (laughing hysterically) I can take you folks to a real campsite, one where there ain't none of this kiddie stuff, like shelter or potable water. Blech.
Soggy Joe: A spectacle much too dangerous to observe--You really should hear the rest of this!
Soggy Joe: Aw.
Soggy Joe: Come on, Massage Train.
Soggy Joe: Gather 'round and hear ye the tale of the Mud Men. Born in the bowels of the bog itself, the mud creatures stalk the inky night, lusting to devour any frogs that might have wandered into their domain. (Sinks beneath the mud)
Soggy Joe: Holes in the ground, eh? And missing valuables too? Sounds like the work of the Magpie beetle.
Soggy Joe: I'll take you all out for pancakes.
Soggy Joe: Name's Joe. Soggy Joe. (laughing)
Soggy Joe: Nature calls. Be right back.
Soggy Joe: No!
Soggy Joe: Oh, great.
Soggy Joe: Oh, no way.
Soggy Joe: Oh, serious?
Soggy Joe: Ooh-wee! (laughs) Good thing I wore my axe-proof vest, eh? So, what'd I miss?
Soggy Joe: Really?
Soggy Joe: So, this place ain't extreme enough for ya?
Soggy Joe: So, you all want to get pancakes early?
Soggy Joe: The Magpie beetle is a rare breed of insect that lives underground. Every 20 years it burrows to the surface and steals junk to make its shell. It presents that shell to prospective mates in a ritual called the "love-nado dance."
Soggy Joe: Unbelievable.
Soggy Joe: Want to hear a tale?
Soggy Joe: We're here. We bunk here for the night. And in the morning, if we're still alive...
Soggy Joe: Wow.
Soggy Joe: Yeah, I have a nose for these things.
Soggy Joe: Yeah, I smell it. It's great. Is that peony?
Soggy Joe: Yeah? Oh? Keep going.
Soldier: Did Grime...
Soldier: Find a happy place. Find a happy place.
Soldier: Harsh.
Soldier: Maybe they, I don't know, forgot?
Soldier: Not the pain room. I hate pain!
Soldier: Oh, way to go.
Soldier: Ooh! Can't believe he actually likes us.
Soldier: Ooh, look at you!
Soldier: Ooh.
Soldier: Uh, it won't happen again, sir.
Soldiers: Whoo!
Sprig & Hop Pop: Around.
Sprig & Polly: (Looking at the music box) Wow.
Sprig & Polly: (screaming)
Sprig & Polly: (shouting)
Sprig & Polly: (sigh)
Sprig & Polly: Don't ask.
Sprig & Polly: Help! Help!
Sprig & Polly: Quest, quest, quest! Quest, quest, quest!
Sprig & Polly: What!?
Sprig & Polly: Whoa!
Sprig & Polly: Whoa.
Sprig & Polly: Woo-hoo!
Sprig (dragging him off the couch): See? You're a natural.
Sprig (face covered): No idea.
Sprig (from a distance): That's weird. Wally always pays his taxes.
Sprig (looking for a seat): Oh! Right in the middle! Dibs!
Sprig (reading): "Congratulations, lucky child. Keep an eye on the grubhog, and don't pull a Plantar." Ouch.
Sprig (to Anne): That's how he fed us when we were babies.
Sprig and Anne: Coming, Hop Pop.
Sprig and Ivy: You're what?
Sprig and Polly: (both gasp)
Sprig and Polly: (gasp)
Sprig and Polly: (scream)
Sprig and Polly: Hop Pop!
Sprig and Polly: Huh?
Sprig and Polly: Oh, no.
Sprig(bursting into Anne's room at home): Anne! I've got it.
Sprig(holding a bundle of stuff): Oh, hi, guys. Come to help?
Sprig(knocking on the door): Gunther, open up!
Sprig(looking at a set of fake teeth): Whoa. Probably shouldn't put these in my mouth. I'm gonna do it. (slurps)
Sprig(reaching for a lever): Yeah, and I think I know how.
Sprig(to Mrs. Croaker): Personally, my favorite thing about Alastair is how he's not afraid to cry.
Sprig(trying to grab Mrs. Croaker's groceries from her): Wait. Uh, let me help you with that. (straining) Whoa!
Sprig, Anne, & Polly (OS): Hop Pop.
Sprig, Polly, & Anne: (together) Tritonio!
Sprig, Polly, & Anne: What?
Sprig, Polly, Anne: (chanting) Suspicion Island! Suspicion Island! Suspicion Island!
Sprig, Polly, Anne: (nervous laughter)
Sprig, Polly: Yeah!
Sprig/Polly: Pizza dreams! Sprig: Oh! Oh! Maybe we should put pineapple on it. Seems like a natural fit. (groans as Anne pins him to the wall)
Sprig/Polly: Pizza! Pizza!
Sprig:  A family Distrusts each other   On a dangerous mission   Like the nearly naked humans On the island of Suspicion   Peruvia, Felicia And Randy, so hot   Beguiling, hostile-ing   We're all Suspicious isle-ing 
Sprig:  Wartwood, O mighty Wartwood 
Sprig: (As he hits Anne back) Heads up!
Sprig: (As he pops out from the ground) Nice swing!
Sprig: (Iaughs) Zing!
Sprig: (Jumping onto Bessie) No regrets!
Sprig: (Opening the back doors) Hey, Hop Pop. How much longer, ya think? Tonight?
Sprig: (Patting his bottom) Out of the way, slowpoke!
Sprig: (Trying to free himself) No! No, no, no, no, no!
Sprig: (blows raspberry) Lucky you.
Sprig: (blows raspberry) This doesn't change a thing. He and I are still gonna spend the day together and have our special time.
Sprig: (breathes heavily)
Sprig: (chuckles) After you, m'lady. What?
Sprig: (chuckles) Nice.
Sprig: (chuckles) No. These are my action figures of the Great Battle of--
Sprig: (chuckles) Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: (chuckles) Yeah. 'Cause I'm a frog. Well, anyways, I wanted you to have these. (Hands over the bag of donuts.)
Sprig: (chuckles) Yep. Hey, uh, sorry about earlier. Got a little carried away.
Sprig: (clears throat) Hello, Ivy. Uh, how's it hanging, Ivy? Hmm. Oh, Ivy. Sorry, didn't see you there. (Suddenly, Ivy pops up from the tree stump, sending him flying.)
Sprig: (clears throat) Maybe somebody is trying to prepare us by forcing us to dive in. Me! I did it.
Sprig: (clears throat) Well, they really looked up to me in Bittyburg. And Ribbitvale was crazy ritzy, but I fit right in. (chuckles) I pretty much have friends in every town from here to Newtopia.
Sprig: (coughs)
Sprig: (dreamy) She's so cool.
Sprig: (feeling cold) Uh, freezing. (He closes the window then goes back to sleep.)
Sprig: (gags, spits) Ow.
Sprig: (gasp) There it is!
Sprig: (gasping)
Sprig: (gasping, panting)
Sprig: (gasps)
Sprig: (gasps) Anne!
Sprig: (gasps) I just had the worst dream. You up, Anne? Anne?
Sprig: (gasps) I knew it.
Sprig: (gasps) I want to touch everything!
Sprig: (gasps) Is that the Spider Spinner? I've heard it's the fastest ride ever made! (sighs) But I guess I'll have to miss it this year.
Sprig: (gasps) Oh, my gosh, they're about to flirt. (squeals)
Sprig: (gasps) That's it! This building used to be someone's home, which means, there was a bathroom!
Sprig: (gasps) You went to the spa? Without us?
Sprig: (gasps; groans)
Sprig: (groans)
Sprig: (groans) (gasping)
Sprig: (groans) Boring old books smelling like dumb old words.
Sprig: (groans) Fine. Thanks for nothin'.
Sprig: (groans) Go away.
Sprig: (groans) I spent all day and I know even less about her than I did before.
Sprig: (groans) Okay.
Sprig: (groans) Stupid books. Stupid learning. Don't they want a real adventure?
Sprig: (groans) The town archives? (grunts) This place is dustier than Dusty's dustbin.
Sprig: (groans) We'll try.
Sprig: (grumbles)
Sprig: (grunting) Ivy, hypothetically, what if I was exaggerating about how much of an out-of-valley expert I was?
Sprig: (grunting) Well, it's locked.
Sprig: (grunting) Whoa! (grunts) Waaah!
Sprig: (grunting, groans)
Sprig: (grunts)
Sprig: (grunts) Oh, that hurt.
Sprig: (grunts) Okay, okay. No problem. We'll just have to take matters into our own hands.
Sprig: (grunts) The archives.
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Croaker?
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Stumpy?
Sprig: (grunts) Was it you, Toadstool?
Sprig: (grunts) What a morning!
Sprig: (grunts, hits him)
Sprig: (gulps)
Sprig: (having an idea) Of course not, Polly. Of course not... Of course-
Sprig: (humming) Mm-hmm. (chuckles) Just look at 'em. And now to watch the flowers of friendship bloom.
Sprig: (in deep voice) I'm the time lord now.
Sprig: (inhales, blubbering as he licks the key) A key that's been in an old man's pocket?
Sprig: (laughing)
Sprig: (laughing) Ambush!
Sprig: (laughing) Hey, you found--
Sprig: (laughs)
Sprig: (laughs) Me too, Polly. Me too.
Sprig: (laughs) My name's Sprig, actually.
Sprig: (laughs) What's a walrus?
Sprig: (loud munching)
Sprig: (muttering) I can leave my towels on the floor of my room.
Sprig: (nervous laugh)
Sprig: (on the speaker) So, Anne, would you rather smell like rotten eggs or have hiccups every day for the rest of your life?
Sprig: (panting)
Sprig: (panting) Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: (pulls out a pain pepper) So hot, they'll make you wish you were dead.
Sprig: (quiet shout) I can't believe it! We're pulling this off!
Sprig: (replying blankly) I have to go to the bathroom. (He exits the room while staring at his friend.)
Sprig: (scoffs and yawns) Wow, what a long day. Goin' straight to bed, if I, uh, can get there without tripping over all these dirty clothes.
Sprig: (scoffs) Cool? More like smelly. Not to mention creepy.
Sprig: (screaming, grunts)
Sprig: (screams)
Sprig: (screams) (yelling) No, no, no, no, no, no, no! (gasps) Anne, Hop Pop, it's me! I've learned my lesson. I promise.
Sprig: (shrieking)
Sprig: (sigh) Will this work?
Sprig: (sighs with relief) Okay.
Sprig: (sighs)
Sprig: (sighs) Anne, that's ridiculous. I'm sick and tired of this and...and...(sighs) We'll do everything we can to help you.
Sprig: (sighs) Fine. Party poopers. Uh, mmm. I know I have it, somewhere. (He accidentaly steps on the lens and it shatters.)
Sprig: (sighs) Glad that's finally over.
Sprig: (sighs) I don't. But I can't let Hop Pop down. He's counting on me.
Sprig: (sighs) I won't, Hop Pop.
Sprig: (sighs) It's just not fair. Just because she's a little younger, she always gets special treatment.
Sprig: (sighs) Should we go help them?
Sprig: (sighs) You're right, Hop Pop.
Sprig: (singsong) And what about me?
Sprig: (sniffing) Worse, Anne. Much worse. Hop Pop is cooking!
Sprig: (sobbing) Don't kill me! Please!
Sprig: (sobbing) He had a family! He had a family!
Sprig: (sobbing) What will I do without you?
Sprig: (sobs) Ivy's birthday is tomorrow, and I've got nothing. (sobs, pants)
Sprig: (spitting)
Sprig: (squeaking) Hey.
Sprig: (squeal)
Sprig: (stammers) Wow! (blows raspberry) Okay.
Sprig: (tearful) I don't know if it's the sweet-smelling toxins or the overwhelming emotions, but dang it, I'm a mess.
Sprig: (to the worker): (grumbles, yells) Hey, you little noodle! This blue shell, you seen it?
Sprig: (weakly) Pizza dreams.
Sprig: (whispers) Trustworthy. Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: (with mouth full) We've been running around all day. We're starving.
Sprig: (worriedly) Anne? Anne! Anne! Anne! Anne!
Sprig: (yells)
Sprig: (yells) I can't take this anymore!
Sprig: (yells) Where's my shell?
Sprig: (yelps) I'll never get to her in time. Unless... (gulps) Ah!
Sprig: A bug that wants to kill us!
Sprig: A copper coin? The mayor? A hole? In the bag? Hmm.
Sprig: A dead end. Well, we tried our best and that's what counts.
Sprig: A new ride. Let's do it.
Sprig: A small price for saving this family!
Sprig: AAGH!!
Sprig: Aaah! Help! It's eating me alive!
Sprig: Aah!
Sprig: Aah! (screaming)
Sprig: Aah! (screams)
Sprig: Aah! Let go!
Sprig: Acting is fun!
Sprig: Actually, that's licorice.
Sprig: After you, best roomie.
Sprig: Ah!
Sprig: Ah! What is it? Danger?
Sprig: Ah, Harvest Day. My favorite holiday.
Sprig: Ah, I don't know, Anne. Whoever wrote this wrote it in a hurry, like they were scared to be here.
Sprig: Ah, come on. No one treats you like a monster, Anne.
Sprig: Ah, forget this. I'm gonna go find Anne.
Sprig: Ah, the annual Plantar fishing trip. I can't wait to cast off.
Sprig: Ah, yes, naturally.
Sprig: Ah...
Sprig: Aha!
Sprig: Aha! (grunting)
Sprig: Ahem, this handsome bachelor happens to be the frog that is going to make Mrs. Croaker like me forever.
Sprig: Ahh-- What? But Hop Pop said, uh--
Sprig: All right, Bessie, we're about to be betrayed... probably. If we're not back in three hours, send for help.
Sprig: All right, Mrs. Croaker. Let's see what you're all about. Huh. Wonder what kind of books she reads.
Sprig: All right, Polly, check this out! According to this map, if we drive straight through the night, we'll be home by morning!
Sprig: All right, maybe someone in town has seen the music box.
Sprig: All right, see ya.
Sprig: All right, yes, on the surface she looks harmless, but do you not remember Sasha?
Sprig: All the way.
Sprig: Alright!
Sprig: Alright, I'm goin' for it!
Sprig: Ambush! Ha ha!
Sprig: And I barely got out of the ant queen's stomach alive! I'm still coughing up acid. (laughs) Blegh!
Sprig: And I brought you some sweets.
Sprig: And I saw all this stuff about Jonah and I thought he was your long-lost love.
Sprig: And guess which family ends up there every year.
Sprig: And it looks like he couldn't take the heat.
Sprig: And predict the weather, yeah.
Sprig: And tasteless. Woof!
Sprig: And the only ones who can do it are... Anne and Hop Pop!
Sprig: And the stingray will jump out and eat it?
Sprig: And you're trying to Vivica her into not trusting me!
Sprig: And you... took it?
Sprig: Anne and Sprig.
Sprig: Anne saved us with her bath bomb.
Sprig: Anne!
Sprig: Anne! (grunts) Ah. That explains the sign.
Sprig: Anne! Anne! Anne! An--
Sprig: Anne! Anne! Anne! Look what I found! A blue moon shell.
Sprig: Anne! Thank goodness. Okay, bye, Mrs. Croaker. Thank you.
Sprig: Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne!
Sprig: Anne, I promise... We're gonna find a way to get you home.
Sprig: Anne, I think I did too much bad cop.
Sprig: Anne, great to see ya. Are you here to join our deer choir?
Sprig: Anne, no pressure, but we're gonna die.
Sprig: Anne, no!
Sprig: Anne, this is totally different. This is about me. I'm totally likable. While you can be a bit...
Sprig: Anne, this place is amazing.
Sprig: Anne, we'd sure appreciate it.
Sprig: Anne, you awake? Anne? (gasps) Anne! Anne! Anne? Anne? Anne. Anne! Anne!
Sprig: Anne, you seem... oddly invested.
Sprig: Anne, you're a genius! We'll just take it to Leopold Loggle, the woodsmith. He loves wood. Almost a little too much.
Sprig: Anne, you're okay!
Sprig: Anne. Anne!
Sprig: Anne? What's going on?
Sprig: Anyone else tasting chocopede pancakes right about now?
Sprig: Are you kidding? That was the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me! My heart was beating faster than a dragonfly on a sugar rush. In fact, I'm feeling a little... sleepy. (snoring) (croaking)
Sprig: Arrest that toad. He stole the town's money and was keeping it all for himself.
Sprig: As long as we're together.
Sprig: At least it'll be a quick, painless death.
Sprig: Attention, fellow freedom fighters. Will someone give up their seat for Sprivy, Wartwood's cutest couple?
Sprig: Aw, come on!
Sprig: Aw, it's not so bad. Maybe we'll learn to love each other. Aah!
Sprig: Aw, man.
Sprig: Aw.
Sprig: Awesome!
Sprig: Back away!
Sprig: Banana?
Sprig: Because seeing you in danger made me realize...it doesn't matter what's fair. What matters is that I'm here to take care of you. We surrender, Polly. (coughs) We... surrender.
Sprig: Behind, eh? Just where a maybe-backstabber would wanna be.
Sprig: Better get to it.
Sprig: Better make it a good one. (whispering) These will be formative memories.
Sprig: Blah!
Sprig: Blech, finally. Come on, Anne.
Sprig: Bleh. (screaming) What the...
Sprig: Boom!
Sprig: Boy, are we glad to see you. We've got a situation. We're not guests. We're--
Sprig: Boy, those toads really stink!
Sprig: Brace yourself.
Sprig: But if he wins maybe we'll get the old Hop Pop back!
Sprig: But maybe Hop Pop will like it. One to go, please. And she said they were strong. I don't feel a thing.
Sprig: But what did I do? Why don't you like me? I mean, I like you.
Sprig: But what if Hop Pop sees us out there?
Sprig: But, uh, end of the day, it's just a shell, right?
Sprig: Charge!
Sprig: Check!
Sprig: Cheer up, guys. Sure we came in last. Again. But thanks to Anne's new ideas and Hop Pop's old ones, we've done the best we've ever done.
Sprig: Chop the grubhog!
Sprig: Come on! Help me break the door down!
Sprig: Come on, Hop Pop!
Sprig: Come on, come on.
Sprig: Come on. It'll be fun! What did you do together?
Sprig: Come on. You know Dusty. Local dust merchant. Friendly, always smiling, sells dust.
Sprig: Come one, come all. Try the beans everybody's screaming about.
Sprig: Coming at ya. (He brings out a large fly. It comes towards Anne.)
Sprig: Cool!
Sprig: Cool.
Sprig: Cop, what?
Sprig: Couldn't hurt to hear a few options.
Sprig: Crazy science lab.
Sprig: Cut it out!
Sprig: Dang it!
Sprig: Danger?
Sprig: Deal with it.
Sprig: Death approaches!
Sprig: Death first!
Sprig: Did I say stink? I meant, are very handsome.
Sprig: Did y'all feel that? (coughs)
Sprig: Do we ever!
Sprig: Does that mean we have to stop?
Sprig: Don't change the subject.
Sprig: Don't know. But isn't it perfect for Ivy? It even whistles when you swing it.
Sprig: Don't mention it! Wanna go buy, like, 500 ant sundaes?
Sprig: Don't play dumb with us! We know that shell's in here somewhere! (Storms into the house.)
Sprig: Don't worry, Anne. We'll do whatever it takes to help you.
Sprig: Don't worry, Hop Pop. There's a town right down the road. See? Ribbitvale.
Sprig: Don't worry, Hop Pop. We'll help you get the stand back.
Sprig: Don't worry. I got you-- Oh!
Sprig: Don't worry. We'll rebuild the tower of books and get you down.
Sprig: Easy?
Sprig: Eesh. Hop Pop is definitely gonna notice something.
Sprig: Eh, I don't know, Anne. That's a wild animal. I'm not sure bringing it home is a good idea.
Sprig: Enough of this negativity! (grunts) Come on, guys. This is our call to frog-venture right here. Did you forget who we are? This gang has been through a lot. And we're gonna make it through this too! I mean, we better. 'Cause if we don't, we'll be trapped here for weeks. No food, no water. Until they find our dehydrated, mummified bodies clawing at the door.
Sprig: Everyone needs to know.
Sprig: Ew, Anne. These leaves are tastier. Here, Bessie. I got dem good leaves, girl.
Sprig: Ew.
Sprig: Excited for the final trial tomorrow, Hop Pop?
Sprig: Excitement!
Sprig: Excuse me. Were you about to fire your best employee?
Sprig: Exhilarating.
Sprig: F-what?
Sprig: Family challenge.
Sprig: Family's amazing!
Sprig: Feeling any better, Hop Pop?
Sprig: Finally!
Sprig: Fine.
Sprig: Five, I say!
Sprig: Five, please!
Sprig: For someone who's Anne's best friend, you sure don't know her very well. She's brave! She's smart! And most of all, she's not gonna be pushed around by a bully like you!
Sprig: Freedom! And check it out. A laundry chute! (laughing)
Sprig: Friend punch!
Sprig: Frog of the hoppin' Year, Anne. Every year, the town gets together and votes on the frog they think best embodies the values of Wartwood.
Sprig: Geez, Loggle.
Sprig: Get in here, you crazy kid.
Sprig: Gifts?
Sprig: Glad that's over with.
Sprig: Good girl.
Sprig: Good idea. It's the right thing to do, even if we get an earful. Back in a flash (He uses his tongue to grab a tree branch and jumps from tree to tree.)
Sprig: Good old reliable on-roading, yes, please.
Sprig: Good thing she didn't show up a few days ago, am I right?
Sprig: Got it.
Sprig: Great. Now let's go.
Sprig: Great. Now, who buys this string?
Sprig: Great. Thanks for the tip.
Sprig: Grubhog, schmub hog. The best part of this holiday is the vomit-inducing, death-defying, unforgettable... rides!
Sprig: Gunther, wait. I shouldn't have accused you like that.
Sprig: Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Check this out! Aaah!
Sprig: Guys, reading these moldy, old books ain't gonna prepare us for squat. What we need is a daring escape from an old, underground library!
Sprig: Guys, seriously, everything's fine.
Sprig: Guys, there's only ten minutes till the dance. Come on!
Sprig: Ha ha ha!
Sprig: Ha ha!
Sprig: Ha! Of course they want the two of us.
Sprig: Ha! Parents, am I right? What do you say we ditch this thing and go watch some fireflies? They're in season.
Sprig: Ha! So that Polly can drop us to cover her tracks, just like Vivica did in the very same episode?
Sprig: Ha-ha! I'm just kidding, guys. Aaah! Aaah!
Sprig: Hang on. I'm coming. (He ends up being dragged as well.)
Sprig: Hanging out with Ivy.
Sprig: Happens all the time. He makes a great scarecrow.
Sprig: Hard to argue with the results though.
Sprig: He can't last much longer!
Sprig: He didn't say anything about using it inside the hotel. (chuckles) Huh?
Sprig: He just moved to Wartwood. Lives out in the woods. Seemed nice. A little too nice.
Sprig: He's crazy.
Sprig: Heck naw.
Sprig: Heck yeah!
Sprig: Heh. This thing broken?
Sprig: Hello. (clears throat) Welcome, fellow frogs. It is my honor to present the one, the only, the-absolutely-real and-not-fake grubhog!
Sprig: Help you? How? (screams)
Sprig: Here we have it.
Sprig: Here you go. Some super-loud snacks you can munch on.
Sprig: Here's hoping.
Sprig: Hey Maddie, what's going on?
Sprig: Hey!
Sprig: Hey! Every time you point, two fingers point back!
Sprig: Hey! Is that Mrs. Croaker?
Sprig: Hey! We're here to rescue you.
Sprig: Hey, Anne. Got time for a visit?
Sprig: Hey, Anne. Sleep good?
Sprig: Hey, Hop Pop...You okay?
Sprig: Hey, I wanna go on the tour too.
Sprig: Hey, I'm her bestie too. I guess that makes me your bestie-in-law. (laughs)
Sprig: Hey, Ivy. I wasn't here talking to myself. That's for sure. (chuckles)
Sprig: Hey, all right!
Sprig: Hey, check it out. I found her diary.
Sprig: Hey, everyone! This is a sham! We're not guests! We're prisoners!
Sprig: Hey, guys. So, you're from Toad Tower?
Sprig: Hey, hey.
Sprig: Hey, let's go explore.
Sprig: Hey, look what I did! (grunts) I'm okay! Statue's broken.
Sprig: Hey, pal, I'm just gonna go for a walk, get some fresh air--
Sprig: Hey, purple ones.
Sprig: Hey, uh, Marcy? Sorry for all the suspicion earlier. I was wrong about you. You're no backstabber.
Sprig: Hey, uh, can we leave now?
Sprig: Hey, um, made you a little something. I used Domino 2's hair balls as the fur. Here ya go.
Sprig: Hey, wake up, wake up!
Sprig: Hey, we kinda need to be a team in here so we don't die, so....
Sprig: Hey-hey! Here comes Mrs. Croaker. Hi, Mrs. Croaker!
Sprig: Hey. You coming?
Sprig: Heya, Jerry.
Sprig: Hi, Anne. What ya doing?
Sprig: Hi, Mrs. Croa...ker...? That was weird. Guys, you aren't gonna believe this, but...I don't think Mrs. Croaker likes me!!
Sprig: Hi, Polly.
Sprig: Hi.
Sprig: Hit me again, Tritonio! (laughs)
Sprig: Hmm, I don't know. He's a friendly little guy. Maybe...we can actually pull this off.
Sprig: Hmm.
Sprig: Hmm. (Grabs an apron off the wall, embroidered with the words 'My Favorite Apron'.) Your favorite apron, right? Sure would be a shame if something (holds it over fireplace) happened to it.
Sprig: Hmm. (gasps) Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, I found it. Okay, Sprig, be cool. Be cool. Come on out, Jonah. Do I have a surprise for you!
Sprig: Hmm. (muttering) I got it! What if we stuck some of these swamp berries to your face? They kinda look like pimples.
Sprig: Hmm. Do you get the feeling this is one of those decisions we'll look back on and say, "Ooh-boy, we probably shouldn't have done that"?
Sprig: Hmm. I will... (pulls out a hammer) set her free!
Sprig: Hmm. Psst, Anne.
Sprig: Hmm. Stranded, eh? Well, couldn't have picked a nicer day.
Sprig: Hmm...
Sprig: Hmm... (A lamp turns on behind him.)
Sprig: Hog overboard!
Sprig: Hold on. Who is that? (gasps) Here he is again. Wait a second. Oh, my gosh. Mrs. Croaker has a long-lost love. Jonah this. Jonah that. Even a map of where he might be. There's a frog out there that wants to be with her, and that she wants to be with.
Sprig: Hold up.
Sprig: Home sweet home.
Sprig: Hoo! All right, folks. Pack it in, we're done.
Sprig: Hop Pop! Marcy, do something!
Sprig: Hop Pop! Mrs. Croaker doesn't like me!
Sprig: Hop Pop's gonna be so disappointed.
Sprig: Hop Pop, it's the fuzz! Everyone scatter! Aah!
Sprig: Hop Pop, this looks really important to you. And the three of us would never want to get in the way of something so person...
Sprig: Hop Pop? (Hop Pop pops out of the water.)
Sprig: How about this? The Chicka-lisk. A beast that eats gold and treasure, doesn't eat Amphibians, won't attack unless threatened, and can be called to any area with a ritual.
Sprig: How am I supposed to sleep without knowing what happened to Vivica and Chad?
Sprig: How can I fix this?
Sprig: How could she not like me? I'm Sprig. The fun Plantar!
Sprig: How heavy was that armor?
Sprig: Huh, you know what? It actually smells kinda nice.
Sprig: Huh. Can you make a new one?
Sprig: Huh. Yeah, no, that's okay. You're right. Like me or don't like me, I'm fine.
Sprig: Huh?
Sprig: Huh? (gasps and ducks, the scythe flying over him into the woods. His hat falls apart, showing his orange hair.) Wanna go again?
Sprig: Huh? Ow.
Sprig: I am.
Sprig: I beat you once, I can do it again. I'll prove my way is right.
Sprig: I call window seat.
Sprig: I can't believe we almost killed each other over a work of fiction.
Sprig: I can't believe we did it!
Sprig: I can't let you do this. The truth is...The truth is I lost the grubhog!
Sprig: I can, and I did. And it's going to save this family.
Sprig: I don't believe this. Went through all that and we still haven't found the--(gasps) Shell! (The shell is sitting on the fence. Ivy drops down next to it.)
Sprig: I don't even remember what she looked like really. Much less the sound of her voice. You know, I've always wondered... can you miss someone you never actually knew? (chuckles) That's silly. I mean, of course you can't.
Sprig: I don't know what's crazier, that you just stole my soul in a tiny box, or that we look so incredible. I gotta say, this friend business is amazing!
Sprig: I don't know. I think the egg is supposed to show us. (drops the egg) Whoops.
Sprig: I don't know. Sometimes it works out.
Sprig: I don't know. The only frogs who can do that are southern tusk frogs. But Gunther doesn't have any tusks.
Sprig: I don't like this game!
Sprig: I don't really know you. And you've never given me any reason not to trust you. I guess I just hopped to conclusions.
Sprig: I don't see it.
Sprig: I don't understand. Why lie about it? Why be miserable?
Sprig: I don't wanna die in a basement!
Sprig: I don't wanna talk about it. Yeah!
Sprig: I even heard her get up in the night. Very suspicious.
Sprig: I froze solid in the night and finally just thawed. (He unfreezes himself.)
Sprig: I got a first-aid kit.
Sprig: I got this! (struggles) Whoa!
Sprig: I gotta admit, she's pretty darn cute.
Sprig: I gotta say, I do feel pretty safe back here. (grunts)
Sprig: I gotta say, as long as you're not being forced to date someone, dances ain't half bad.
Sprig: I guess all we can do now is wait for Marcy.
Sprig: I have a bad feeling about this. So I'm gonna go follow Anne and watch over her.
Sprig: I have a completely reasonable plan for getting Mrs. Croaker to like me.
Sprig: I have a plan. Stand up!
Sprig: I have no idea what that means.
Sprig: I hope you'll be okay, Anne.
Sprig: I knew it was important to you. So, I played along. I just wanted to make you proud.
Sprig: I knew it! You just couldn't wait to move out!
Sprig: I know it stinks, but how about some careless misadventuring to take your mind off it? I think there's a creepy lagoon nearby.
Sprig: I know! I'm just fired up, Anne.
Sprig: I know, right?
Sprig: I like this Alastair. He's ethereal, yet approachable.
Sprig: I mean, who can say really?
Sprig: I owe her my first-born child.
Sprig: I still can't believe you're bringing us to a day care, Hop Pop.
Sprig: I thought you had the same tradition back home!
Sprig: I thought you'd never ask. (He tries to leave, but sees that he is handcuffed to Hop Pop.) You handcuffed us together?!
Sprig: I want it. Give it to me.
Sprig: I want names, you worm.
Sprig: I want to find out who's guilty just as much as you do. Let me help you.
Sprig: I wanted to get you to like me. So I kind of...snuck into your house and secretly went through all your things. (groans)
Sprig: I was blinking, wasn't I?
Sprig: I was kinda hoping it'd be a surprise. (chuckles)
Sprig: I will do no such thing! I trust my community. And frankly, Anne, I pity you for not trusting yours.
Sprig: I'll do you one better. I'll take you right to her.
Sprig: I'm going to hunt down that frog and reunite them. And then, she won't like me. Oh, no. She'll love me.
Sprig: I'm gonna sand your face!
Sprig: I'm just glad you're okay.
Sprig: I'm likable. I'm lovable.
Sprig: I'm not really sure I'm ready for this.
Sprig: I'm sure she's got her reasons.
Sprig: I've always wanted to try road rage.
Sprig: I-I can't get up.
Sprig: If Anne wants hard-core, we go hard-core. Lead the way, Mr., uh...
Sprig: If the thief stole once, it'll steal again. The only way to catch this monster is a stakeout.
Sprig: If we don't do something now, it won't be long before their bickering tears this family apart.
Sprig: In two days?
Sprig: Is it here? (Smashes vase.)
Sprig: Is now a good time to mention that we've also allied with an army of mushroom zombies.
Sprig: Is this extreme enough?
Sprig: It says here this place belonged to Great Uncle Skip Plantar. He was a farmer and a brilliant scientist! He experimented with all kinds of stuff. This is wild. I wanna know more! Like, what does this do? (Pulls lever)
Sprig: It's a big, scary tower deep in the swamp and the toads that live there are the valley's fiercest warriors.
Sprig: It's all so clear now.
Sprig: It's cool you know your mom, though. Mine passed away when me and Polly were really young.
Sprig: It's fun 'cause it doesn't hurt! (being hit) Ow! (He swings the pillow and almost drops one of his action figures.) Oops! Just gonna move General Bogbreath safely over here.
Sprig: It's like nothing I've ever seen before. A ten-tier fountain. A solid gold snail carriage. There's even a One-Eyed Wally. Wait. What?
Sprig: It's not a holiday, Anne. It's the annual Blue Moon Shut-In.
Sprig: It's so pretty. I'm sure your mom's gonna love it.
Sprig: It's the Mud Men!
Sprig: It's the music box!
Sprig: It's the perfect way to spend the night before we hear from the king.
Sprig: It's true.
Sprig: It's working. They're... connecting.
Sprig: Ivy asked for a red sunshell from the Newtopian coast. To match my blue moonshell.
Sprig: Ivy, I'm sorry I didn't get you a red sunshell. (Ivy friendly punches Sprig) Ow!
Sprig: Ivy, wait! I'd love to. Mlep! Wanna dance?
Sprig: Ivy?
Sprig: Jonah, this isn't romantic!
Sprig: Just let me have this lie!
Sprig: Just one of Mother Nature's horrible mistakes.
Sprig: Just think. Home for breakfast.
Sprig: Just trust me. All right. One, two... three!
Sprig: Justice is extreme, Anne! (pants) Besides, we only have one name left on our list. Which means...we've got our guy.
Sprig: Kids around here don't really get me.
Sprig: Knowledge hurts.
Sprig: Let us out!
Sprig: Levers are for pulling, Anne! Why is there a death trap here, anyways?
Sprig: Look at this place. So cozy.
Sprig: Look out! Okay, how do we turn it off?
Sprig: Look! More Annes!
Sprig: Look, Hop Pop, I don't know why you did what you did, but you gotta fix it.
Sprig: Look, over there.
Sprig: Lookin' good, Patrick.
Sprig: Looks like it's time to crank up the charm on this widow.
Sprig: Love is the cruelest weapon.
Sprig: Maddie gave it to me.
Sprig: Man, Tritonio's so encouraging.
Sprig: Man, this is a long hallway. (grunts)
Sprig: Man, you were right. We didn't need to read some silly book. You drive just fine.
Sprig: May I? (grunts) I think you should do the honors.
Sprig: Maybe it's harmless.
Sprig: Maybe...
Sprig: Me!
Sprig: Me, me, me. I'm her best friend.
Sprig: Mediocrity is comforting.
Sprig: Mine!
Sprig: Mm, boy am I glad Anne forgave you. Some people would carry the scars of that betrayal for life. Not you two, though. (laughs)
Sprig: Mm-hmm. Onward family! To Newtopia!
Sprig: Mmm!
Sprig: Mmm.
Sprig: More important?
Sprig: My fiancee was right! (all grunting)
Sprig: Never heard of it.
Sprig: Never! I'm not about to let my first real friend get eaten. We're in this together.
Sprig: Nice one.
Sprig: Nighttime swim. As well.
Sprig: No problem, Felicia. I had a tea-rrific time.
Sprig: No problem. Anything else I can get ya?
Sprig: No way. Pssh. It's no trouble.
Sprig: No way. Those eyes he gave me earlier, those were "I'm proud of you, Sprig" eyes. I've only seen them maybe twice. So, you just go and enjoy those incredible rides without me.
Sprig: No!
Sprig: No! She's stealing the sacred flag! Quick, sound the alarm!
Sprig: No, I mean it. Don't the toads seem a little... on edge?
Sprig: No, no! This can't be! They're fighting again.
Sprig: No, no, all yours.
Sprig: No, no. It's okay. Thank you, Deer Stumpy and Deer Croaker. Take five, deer friends.
Sprig: No, thank you, buddy.
Sprig: No, they won't. This is Wartwood, Anne, not some den of thieves.
Sprig: No, wait! Mrs. Croaker, come back. (sobbing) Acknowledge me!
Sprig: No, wait, stop! Aaah! (He dodges but accidentally hits his action figure and breaks it apart.)
Sprig: No.
Sprig: No. (grunts) Okay, we did!
Sprig: No. Ha! If you wanna hang out with some grody toads, Anne, be my guest. No skin off my skin.
Sprig: No. He's right. She is just an old woman. I'll save you, Mrs. Croaker.
Sprig: Noooooooo! (The bus takes off.)
Sprig: Nope, they were twisted.
Sprig: Nope. I'm here on behalf of Sadie Croaker.
Sprig: Not a big deal? Do you remember the Henderson's next door? They used to argue all the time, and look what happened to them.
Sprig: Not if I get there first.
Sprig: Not jealous!
Sprig: Not really.
Sprig: Not that it's a big deal. (chuckles)
Sprig: Of course we are!
Sprig: Of course.
Sprig: Oh, Anne. Looks like you've solved the puzzle...of your own heart.
Sprig: Oh, Hop Pop!
Sprig: Oh, I know. Let's just open some doors at random. One of them's gotta be an exit.
Sprig: Oh, Joe, there were these crazy cannibals.
Sprig: Oh, absolutely. But now those two have to spend the whole night together and bond!
Sprig: Oh, and there was a pumpkin abomination! A real affront to nature. I loved it! And then betrayed it.
Sprig: Oh, come on!
Sprig: Oh, come on, guys. Surely you don't trust this "Marcy" person.
Sprig: Oh, come on. Anne.
Sprig: Oh, crud. Okay, you. Put 'em up.
Sprig: Oh, hey, it's maple.
Sprig: Oh, let me help!
Sprig: Oh, let me help, let me help! You know my underwater sight is better than yours. (He tests his eyes.) Eh? Eh?
Sprig: Oh, me! I love scary stories.
Sprig: Oh, my frog, oh, my frog, oh, my frog!
Sprig: Oh, my gosh!
Sprig: Oh, no, you don't!
Sprig: Oh, no?
Sprig: Oh, nothing, best roomie. Anyways, good night. (goes to sleep)
Sprig: Oh, oh, oh! Let's adopt that pumpkin monster.
Sprig: Oh, okay, okay, sure. Oh! How about this? (He holds up a bike pump.) What does this do? (He pumps air into his mouth and speaks with a muffled voice.) It's painful. (The air hisses as it comes out) Oh, and this. (He clicks a cat pen.) Oh, I love this. This is amazing.
Sprig: Oh, right. (To the worker) Your hair looks incredible. (grunts)
Sprig: Oh, right. Happy early birthday, Ivy.
Sprig: Oh, she got you again!
Sprig: Oh, sorry, Anne. You okay? (chuckles)
Sprig: Oh, sure. Didn't you know two-thirds of all mates start with souls? Ah! I mean, two-thirds of all souls start with...(sighs) I can't do this. I'm really sorry, Ivy. I-- I don't want to date you. Everyone just convinced me this was a good idea.
Sprig: Oh, sure. Here you go!
Sprig: Oh, thank frog. Finally.
Sprig: Oh, thank goodness you're all right, you beautiful, precious princess.
Sprig: Oh, thank goodness. I was beginning to think I'd never get my Royal Credit Card with unlimited funds back.
Sprig: Oh, thank you so much for stopping. I, uh--
Sprig: Oh, that's good.
Sprig: Oh, that's just waxed yarn. They sell it at the Grub and Go.
Sprig: Oh, that's okay. (gasps)
Sprig: Oh, that's right, Polly. I'm going to steal more corn right under their noses. They'll have to do this again tomorrow, and the next night, and the next night, until they're the bestest friends who were ever friends, and then the family will be saved! (sinister chuckle)
Sprig: Oh, there they are.
Sprig: Oh, uh, hey Sog Man. Everything okay?
Sprig: Oh, we've got a lake. Would going there with me make you feel less homesick?
Sprig: Oh, yeah, totally.
Sprig: Oh, yeah. The royal credit card.
Sprig: Oh, yeah? And how are we doing that?
Sprig: Oh, yeah? Well, that's just what Chad Vanderblad said. Right before he was stabbed in the back by a backstabber on Suspicion Island!
Sprig: Oh, you horrible, horrible, sweet boy. Forgive me.
Sprig: Oh.
Sprig: Oh. This was not here last week.
Sprig: Oh. Was it because you're a criminal?
Sprig: Ohhh!
Sprig: Okay!
Sprig: Okay, Anne. That's enough.
Sprig: Okay, fair point, fair point. But who cares what they think? We like you.
Sprig: Okay, the books fell, and you're stuck and blocking our only way out.
Sprig: Okay, the music box has to be here somewhere. Whoa! We have to find it!
Sprig: Okay, we can do this. We just gotta go very slowly--
Sprig: Okay.
Sprig: Okay. (He digs under the ground.)
Sprig: Okay. Good night.
Sprig: Okay. Let's get this show on the road. Mrs. Croaker! Do I have a surprise for you.
Sprig: Okay. So, Marcy, I've got a couple of questions. How'd you get so smart? What's your cloak made out of? What's in this pouch? Where'd you get that wrist thing? (whispers) What was Anne like back home?
Sprig: On it!
Sprig: One ant cream sundae, my good man.
Sprig: Oof, you probably dislike teachers more than ever now, huh, Anne?
Sprig: Oof. Are you sure meddling is a good idea?
Sprig: Ooh! What if we use fishing line to lower me from the ceiling? Then I grab the key right out of Hop Pop's pocket. I'll move like a shadow.
Sprig: Ooh, I forgot to mention the shame nuggets. (crowd jeering)
Sprig: Ooh, I love grubs.
Sprig: Ooh, exciting. I guess I'd better get an item for Ivy, since we are an item. (laughs, snorts) Who are you gonna shop for?
Sprig: Ooh, ooh! Can we get Swamp Slushies? They have new flavors.
Sprig: Ooh, tempting. But, nope. I'd rather fish. It's what Hop Pop and I have done on this trip ever since I was a pollywog. (gasps) First we'd get the bait ready.
Sprig: Oooh. A corpse-maker moth. (clears throat) You're supposed to kiss when you see one, otherwise your crops will be cursed for seven years. (pecks Ivy's cheek) Just to be safe.
Sprig: Oop. sound like the mission briefing bell.
Sprig: Open it, open it!
Sprig: Or had legs?
Sprig: Or maybe Anne needs fewer blankets.
Sprig: Or maybe here? (Smashes carriage clock.)
Sprig: Our families! We gotta help them!
Sprig: Over here, over here. I need a ride.
Sprig: Ow! Whoops. Why are we wearing these again?
Sprig: Pipes! Aha! Here it is! The blueprints!
Sprig: Please, governor, I'm a poor orphan boy who done and twisted his wee ankle on these here train tracks.
Sprig: Polly!
Sprig: Polly, are you okay?
Sprig: Power-ups?
Sprig: Pretty sure I just got played.
Sprig: Promise?
Sprig: Really wish we had some sunlight right about now.
Sprig: Reconciliation!
Sprig: Remain calm. You got it, buddy.
Sprig: Retreat, my dear brethren!
Sprig: Right behind ya.
Sprig: Right.
Sprig: River lampreys! What are we gonna do?
Sprig: Room for two more?
Sprig: Say what? Come on, Hop Pop. I got here first. (grunts)
Sprig: See guys? How do you feel about diving in now?
Sprig: See ya, Ivy!
Sprig: See? That could've been on purpose.
Sprig: See? Told you it was harmless.
Sprig: Seems reasonable to me.
Sprig: Shadows knock things over sometimes.
Sprig: She can't find out, Anne. What if she gets mad? What if she thinks I don't like her? The relationship will be over before it starts!
Sprig: She likes me!
Sprig: She likes me! Aw, yeah! Wa-pow! Good thing I brought this. (Pulls out a hat emblazoned with the words "She Likes Me".) She likes me. She likes me.
Sprig: She said she wanted to be alone.
Sprig: She's diseased!
Sprig: Shiny.
Sprig: Should we be concerned about this? (lifts his leg, which Domino 2 is nibbling on)
Sprig: So I'm just supposed to go back to the way things were? You never listened to us.
Sprig: So did you get the beetle jerky you--Hey, what's wrong?
Sprig: So does anyone else think this just looks like we're robbing a real train?
Sprig: So we did it! We dove into another adventure and escaped! I told you it would work.
Sprig: So what are we gonna do with the extra gold?
Sprig: So what's this then? Outhouse. It's an outhouse.
Sprig: So, awkward question, but are you sure you wouldn't be happier back home?
Sprig: So, is punching part of friendship?
Sprig: So, you guys wanna get breakfast and come up with some kind of plan to get Anne home?
Sprig: So, you really think this is your key to getting home?
Sprig: So...Not good.
Sprig: So...you're looking like a... girl frog.
Sprig: Sold!
Sprig: Something's not right here. Let's just go back.
Sprig: Sorry, Anne. After all we worked for too.
Sprig: Sorry, Hop Pop. But I've had it with this pollywog and her special treatment. We ain't backing down!
Sprig: Sorry, I got tied up.
Sprig: Sorry, Polly. But me and Anne have changed. We're different now.
Sprig: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Sprig: Sounds good.
Sprig: Sounds like he's in trouble. We're coming, Hop Pop! (They run into the house, then into Anne's room.) Hop Pop! Hop Pop!
Sprig: Spranne against the world.
Sprig: Sprig out! Peace!
Sprig: Sprig.
Sprig: Suit yourself.
Sprig: Sure did! Oh, you're gonna steal it, aren't you?
Sprig: Sure do. It's a literal board.
Sprig: Sure, it seems cool, until you realize all you do here is read other people's cool adventures.
Sprig: Take that, buzz brains! Go sting someone your own size!
Sprig: Take that, you beautiful creature!
Sprig: Take this, you brutes!
Sprig: Talk about an emotional roller coaster--
Sprig: Thank frog!
Sprig: Thanks, Anne. When the moment strikes, I'll know it.
Sprig: Thanks, Hop Pop.
Sprig: Thanks, Joe!
Sprig: Thanks, Mrs. Croaker.
Sprig: Thanks, Polly, but maybe next time we do it your way. (sighs)
Sprig: Thanks, Stumpy.
Sprig: Thanks. I'll give you the grand tour. Let's start with the crown jewels.
Sprig: That is Albus Duckweed. He writes reviews for the paper. They have comic strips sometimes.
Sprig: That should do it.
Sprig: That was my next guess!
Sprig: That wasn't just any cane. It was Hop Pop's special cane, passed down from his father, Hop Poppity Pop, all the way from his father, Hop-and-Lock-Drop Soppity Pop.
Sprig: That wasn't your fault.
Sprig: That's Deer Sprig to you.
Sprig: That's Monroe. He and Hop Pop have been rivals forever.
Sprig: That's gonna be hard to forget. (chuckles) Ooh, candy. (He tries taking a piece from a bowl, but it's all stuck together.) Ew, gross. Uh-oh. (The candy sticks to his hand; while trying to get it off he damages her cabinet.)
Sprig: That's right, Mama Sprig is here.
Sprig: That's right. I lost the grubhog because I was goofing off at the fair. Anne and I tricked you all to cover it up.
Sprig: That's so Hop Pop!
Sprig: That's the spirit!
Sprig: That's what we're here for.
Sprig: That's, uh...That's pretty dark.
Sprig: The Bizarre Bazaar. I've never been, but I've heard stories. It's a mysterious night market that passes through once a year. Exotic foods, games, mysterious treasures.
Sprig: The Grub-N-Go's hiring greeters! All you gotta do is smile and be friendly.
Sprig: The cannibal couple from the inn!
Sprig: The ceremony starts in five minutes!
Sprig: The cruelest toad soldier of all time?
Sprig: The drama.
Sprig: The heck was that? It's like she's a different person.
Sprig: The injustice! The outrage! We've gotta catch this thief!
Sprig: The jig is up. Run!
Sprig: The lake!
Sprig: The loud snacking. The freezing cold. Lights on at all hours. Guess Spranne really is a bust.
Sprig: The taxes! You fiends! Everyone's gonna be furious when they find out about this.
Sprig: The what and the who?
Sprig: Then he'd let me steer the boat.
Sprig: Then let's stop wasting time and find who stole my shell already! (sips) Actually, there's nothing in here.
Sprig: Then maybe it's time this bad cop goes good. (Rips off mustache.) Oh, that really hurts.
Sprig: Then that's what we'll do, together.
Sprig: Then we need cursed obsidian to amplify the dark energy.
Sprig: Then we'd spend the rest of the day fishing together. We look forward to this all year. It's our special time, and that's never gonna change.
Sprig: There could be treasure.
Sprig: There we go.
Sprig: There's more where that came from.
Sprig: There's no time! Come on! (runs in screaming)
Sprig: There, there, you beautiful, disgusting thing.
Sprig: There, there. Easy does it.
Sprig: There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
Sprig: These are horrifying.
Sprig: These chains represent our burden on society!
Sprig: They didn't do anything weird. Or different. Or fun. I mean, look at this. Even this painting's making me feel depressed. What the... Whoa!
Sprig: They want the garbage potion!
Sprig: Think this'll lead us to the box?
Sprig: Think we touched a nerve there.
Sprig: This a cult thing? (stomach growls)
Sprig: This bellhop recommended the Ferris wheel, but also went above and beyond her duty by showing it to me personally. I think the Newt King, who I happen to know, would be upset if she didn't get a raise!
Sprig: This is awesome. Just look at all these gifts.
Sprig: This is the price of progress, Hop Pop.
Sprig: This isn't so bad, I guess. There is a cool tower.
Sprig: This place is amazing. Whoa! Oh, what this? (exclaims) (laughs) Wow!
Sprig: This plan is flawless!
Sprig: This stinks.
Sprig: This string was found at the scene of a crime. And only you use it. Talk!
Sprig: This was all a setup. They trap passengers at the inn. We're the "breakfast" in "bed and breakfast."
Sprig: Time in! (The fight continues.)
Sprig: To keep an eye on the grubhog.
Sprig: To keep it a secret, obviously. Who wouldn't want to steal this stuff?
Sprig: Toadie, buddy.
Sprig: Toads! They're everywhere. We barely slipped out while the guards were--
Sprig: Too late.
Sprig: Too much?
Sprig: Truly a once in a lifetime experience.
Sprig: Try and stop me! Ha-ha!
Sprig: Ugh, those traitors!
Sprig: Uh, Anne, do you think maybe you're taking this a little too seriously?
Sprig: Uh, Hop Pop, are you okay?
Sprig: Uh, Hop Pop.
Sprig: Uh, I'm sorry. It's just that the caterpillar looked just like Anne's pet from back home. It was small, cute. It was black with white spots and it--
Sprig: Uh, did we just get locked in here?
Sprig: Uh, hello. (Swinging his tongue to Anne) Anne can bunk with me in my room. How fun will that be?
Sprig: Uh, hey, Anne? Thanks for sticking with me today. It was a ride I won't forget.
Sprig: Uh, hey, Felicia. Where's Ivy?
Sprig: Uh, hey, Hop Pop, what's the worst thing Charlie Bigbottom ever did, since we're talking about Charlie Bigbottom?
Sprig: Uh, hey, Hop Pop? Something's not right here.
Sprig: Uh, is it broken?
Sprig: Uh, it's cicadas coming out to graze. Which is totally fine. If you just stay super quiet, they should go away.
Sprig: Uh, maybe I can fix it. Aha! Good as new! (He sneezes and the pieces fly everywhere.)
Sprig: Uh, nothing. Everything's fine.
Sprig: Uh, sweat melted cheese. Frogs don't sweat, so I'd be cheese-free.
Sprig: Uh, thanks.
Sprig: Uh, we call it a win-win here too, Anne. (gasps) Look!
Sprig: Uh, what's so bad about teachers?
Sprig: Uh, what?
Sprig: Uh, yeah. But...
Sprig: Uh-oh.
Sprig: Uh...
Sprig: Uh... (chuckles)... Sasha, shouldn't me and Ivy be partners?
Sprig: Uh... (nervous laughter)
Sprig: Uh... Hop Pop?
Sprig: Uh... hi.
Sprig: Uh... these are for you.
Sprig: Uh...What have I done?
Sprig: Um, there, there?
Sprig: Veggie-robo!
Sprig: Wa-ta!
Sprig: Wait! Wouldn't we be better off preparing by diving headfirst into deadly situations?
Sprig: Wait, no, Ivy!
Sprig: Wait, what?
Sprig: Wait, you don't think he's gonna...
Sprig: Wait. You work directly for the king of Amphibia?
Sprig: Watch this...
Sprig: We all get to ride in that? Awesome!
Sprig: We ate most of them. But there's, like, three left.
Sprig: We did it!
Sprig: We didn't rob a train.
Sprig: We got your note.
Sprig: We gotta find that music box or Anne'll never forgive him.
Sprig: We gotta hide somewhere. Stumpy! Stumpy! Stumpy! Stumpy!
Sprig: We made it.
Sprig: We made it. And it looks like Hop Pop's still washing Polly. (Polly, still dirty, is bouncing around the house.)
Sprig: We'll be the ones asking questions.
Sprig: We'll come visit you, Anne. We promise.
Sprig: We'll win for sure with this, Hop Pop.
Sprig: We're being chased.
Sprig: We're done here.
Sprig: We're going to the Bizarre Bazaar tonight, aren't we?
Sprig: We're going to the lake. Ooh. Ow.
Sprig: We're gonna die down here!
Sprig: We're not allowed to leave? Why's that?
Sprig: We're sorry!
Sprig: We've been robbed!
Sprig: Well, Ferris wheel. The time has come.
Sprig: Well, I don't want to live in a town with someone who likes Hunter.
Sprig: Well, I guess we'll just sit back quietly and watch.
Sprig: Well, I learned from the best. Now let's finish this up.
Sprig: Well, I obviously can't... because I have the attention span of a... Oh, look at that.
Sprig: Well, I say we watch "Marbles" like a pigeon hawk. That way we can be ready if she tries to pull anything funny. You guys with me?
Sprig: Well, I'm going to break into her house, search through her belongings, find the key to her secret wishes, and make them all come true.
Sprig: Well, all right, if you say so. (grunting)
Sprig: Well, anyone who likes Alastair can get behind me!
Sprig: Well, at least she's a good mother.
Sprig: Well, don't wanna get this thing dirty. (whistles)
Sprig: Well, hey, I promise I won't judge you anymore.
Sprig: Well, in your defense, that game was a ding dang cheat!
Sprig: Well, looks like we gotta go. (chuckles) See ya.
Sprig: Well, next time I head out of the valley, maybe you can come with me. I mean if you want, no big deal.
Sprig: Well, no. It's a long story, but--
Sprig: Well, one thing's for sure. We have to lie.
Sprig: Well, that's lucky. Will you give me a lift back home? It's urgent.
Sprig: Well, the jokes on you. Anne and Polly would never leave me. (He sees Anne and Polly getting off the bus.)
Sprig: Well, then, why don't I be your friend in the meantime?
Sprig: Well, time to go!
Sprig: Well, we did our best. And isn't that what counts?
Sprig: Well, we got results, didn't we?
Sprig: Well, ya gotta catch me first. (raspberry)
Sprig: Well... I, uh...(groans)...Of course I will! There's nothing more important to me than family. Rides are for dum-dums anyway. (chuckles)
Sprig: Welp, I've got a house to break into, so...
Sprig: Were they really all just farm frogs? Where are the artists? The poets? The dreamers?
Sprig: Wha-- Huh?
Sprig: Wha...
Sprig: What a twist!
Sprig: What are we gonna do? We're stuck.
Sprig: What are we here for again?
Sprig: What are you doing here?
Sprig: What are you doing?
Sprig: What do I look like, a slob?
Sprig: What happened? Are you okay?
Sprig: What just happened?
Sprig: What the heck's going on?
Sprig: What the heck? He can't fish in that ridiculous outfit.
Sprig: What was that?
Sprig: What's gone?
Sprig: What's it say, Marcy? What's it say?!
Sprig: What's she like?
Sprig: What's that supposed to mean?
Sprig: What's the emergency?
Sprig: What's the plan this year, Hop Pop? Poison the competition? Ooh!
Sprig: What's up with canes? Who even needs them these days, am I right? Ow.
Sprig: What's wrong, Anne?
Sprig: What's wrong? Are you stung? We'll have to amputate.
Sprig: What, Anne?
Sprig: What?
Sprig: What? (grunts)
Sprig: What? (yells)
Sprig: What? Anything. What?
Sprig: What? Did we do it? Did we actually win?
Sprig: What? No! I didn't watch anything. It must have been Polly.
Sprig: What? No.
Sprig: What? She should pick Alastair. He's a thinker. A dreamer.
Sprig: What? That's adorable.
Sprig: What? The outhouse?
Sprig: What? You're siding with Hop Pop?
Sprig: When I count to three, duck.
Sprig: Where are we?
Sprig: Where are you hiding it? (Rips pillow.)
Sprig: Where'd that happen again?
Sprig: Where's that darn leak? Come on! Come on!
Sprig: Whew! Hope there isn't a Domino 3. (laughs)
Sprig: Who knew ultimate flavor could be so painful?
Sprig: Who's Hue?
Sprig: Who's this Otto?
Sprig: Whoa!
Sprig: Whoa! Guys, look what I found! I think it's an entry ticket for the Bizarre Bazaar!
Sprig: Whoa! I'm into this.
Sprig: Whoa! Nice shot.
Sprig: Whoa! Phew.
Sprig: Whoa! What are these things?
Sprig: Whoa! Whoa!
Sprig: Whoa! Yeah, Hop Pop!
Sprig: Whoa, ho, ho, ho! We get to explore Newtopia with unlimited money?! This is a dream come true! Onward, family! Time to see Newtopia!
Sprig: Whoa, these are big forks.
Sprig: Whoa, whoa, hey. She is not for eating.
Sprig: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sprig: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute. There may be another way.
Sprig: Whoa.
Sprig: Whoa. How'd I do that? Huh? Ivy?
Sprig: Whoo!
Sprig: Whoo! (The ladybug moves very slowly.) Can't this thing go any faster?!
Sprig: Whoo! Dance it up, Hop Pop!
Sprig: Whoo! Yeah! I like that.
Sprig: Whoo-hoo!
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! Go Polly!
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! See you later, cicadas! (blows raspberry)
Sprig: Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Sprig: Why don't you just ask him why he's doing it? Tritonio says, "An honest dialogue is more powerful than any weapon."
Sprig: Why me? Ow! Why always me? (screams)
Sprig: Why, thank you, friend.
Sprig: Woah. Not getting good vibes from this room.
Sprig: Wonder what those are for.
Sprig: Wouldn't it be better if we found some plants to fight?
Sprig: Wow, Anne, look at all your cool stuff! What's this? (He picks up a toenail clipper.) Ah, I get it. Torture device.
Sprig: Wow, so cool.
Sprig: Wow, we sure are learning a lot. I'd like to learn more. Like, hey, what does this do? (Pulls a lever.)
Sprig: Wow. Man, this is way better than that stuffy old dance. Right, Ivy? Ivy? Ivy?
Sprig: Yahoo!
Sprig: Yeah!
Sprig: Yeah! That's a great idea, Anne. Ha! (grunts)
Sprig: Yeah! This is amazing! Not only are we having fun, but I'm also doing Hop Pop proud!
Sprig: Yeah! Whoa, Loggle. We gotta talk about this, man. We're comin' back. We're gonna talk about this. All right, good-bye.
Sprig: Yeah, I don't think this thing's getting back up.
Sprig: Yeah, I just fell in love with her.
Sprig: Yeah, I kicked him!
Sprig: Yeah, I probably could have ended that speech earlier.
Sprig: Yeah, I'm not generally a mad kid, Anne.
Sprig: Yeah, Loggle, cut the chitchat!
Sprig: Yeah, but--
Sprig: Yeah, get out of here, you fraud!
Sprig: Yeah, how do we know that one isn't some kind of trapdoor?
Sprig: Yeah, kinda seems like she's tasting me.
Sprig: Yeah, looks like we're stuck here. Ooh! I know what'll be fun. Let's try some of Hop Pop's pain peppers. So hot, they'll make you wish you were dead. (humming) (screaming) Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! (gurgling) Someone just kill me, please! Bleh. Your turn.
Sprig: Yeah, memories. Too bad about that grubhog though. I hope he's in a better place.
Sprig: Yeah, on it!
Sprig: Yeah, page five is as far as I got. Too much description, not enough plot.
Sprig: Yeah, we're gonna make it after all.
Sprig: Yeah, we're good here in the wagon.
Sprig: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Anne looks at the photo again) Is gon' be great.
Sprig: Yeah. It's great.
Sprig: Yeah... ow.
Sprig: Yep!
Sprig: Yep, I blew up the pizza.
Sprig: Yep.
Sprig: Yep. Don't you hear Hop Pop yodel himself to sleep every night?
Sprig: Yep. What's the problem?
Sprig: Yes!
Sprig: Yes! Don't worry, Anne! I'm on my way!
Sprig: Yes, Anne. But she didn't just steal the shell. She stole my heart.
Sprig: Yes, and I'm rich, so deal with it!
Sprig: Yes, and I'm rich, so deal with it. Ha ha!
Sprig: Yes, of course. So sorry.
Sprig: Yes. Sensing something is wrong.
Sprig: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Sprig: You all right, girl?
Sprig: You go, girl!
Sprig: You got it. Am I still here?
Sprig: You got me convinced.
Sprig: You got the job?
Sprig: You got this, bud.
Sprig: You gotta be kidding me.
Sprig: You guys talkin' scum?
Sprig: You hate it, don't ya? It's too ugly, isn't it? You know what, give it back to me--
Sprig: You knock 'em down. (He swims into the water and distracts two fishes. He hits one to above water and Anne hits it. The two fishes then make a spinning attack.)
Sprig: You know what, Anne, you're right. This is not okay.
Sprig: You know what, Anne? You're right. I can't just let this go. I have to get Mrs. Croaker to like me. And I can't do that unless I know more about her. Fact-finding mission, engage! Haha!
Sprig: You know, I've never actually tasted a tomato. No one in town really sells them.
Sprig: You leave her alone!
Sprig: You lied and buried the music box, causing Anne to almost leave the family forever?
Sprig: You lose, Polly. Looks like your special treatment couldn't help you this time. Now just surrender--
Sprig: You mean this Skip Man?
Sprig: You ready to go?
Sprig: You ready?
Sprig: You said "love" twice.
Sprig: You were right. This town is a dirty cesspool of vice. (munches) Disgusting.
Sprig: You wouldn't be saying that if you were the pawn.
Sprig: You're a hopping genius, Anne!
Sprig: You're almost there!
Sprig: You're an only child, Anne. You don't understand. I'm always giving up things for Polly. Well, no more! The only way to end this is if Polly submits to me!
Sprig: You've gotta help.
Sprig: You... You mean it? I have to admit, most of my ideas were pretty terrible. I think we even caused permanent damage to the ecosystem.
Sprig: Your... mom?
Sprig: Yup! And you know who's gonna love it? Ivy! Tomorrow's her birthday. And this is the perfect gift.
Sprig: Yup.
Sprig: Yup. But never mind that. Look. The blue moon shell. Right where I left it. Wait. Wait a minute. What? The shell. The shell's not here. I've been robbed!
Sprig: Yup. So, you must be so excited to be trapped in another world. Very jealous. Oh!
Sprig: ly...
Sprig:...likable. Also.
Sprig:Anne, are you... okay?
Stumpy: (Stumpy laughs) Nice shot. Direct hit! You got it. Whoo!
Stumpy: (laughs) I knew about that garbage lizard.
Stumpy: (scoffs) Creepy kid.
Stumpy: All right. (guffaws) Who's a good little mudskipper?
Stumpy: And I can't wait for that Newtopian coral hand fitment. Thanks for pickin' it up for me.
Stumpy: Anne, calm down. Maybe we can't save the restaurant, but we sure can save those people's lives. What do you say?
Stumpy: Aye, lass, but then you'd never be able to caress a wee baby tadpole. Or hold hands with the love of your live!
Stumpy: Coming right up!
Stumpy: Croaker? She's just a kooky old spider lady. What's there to know?
Stumpy: Dang mushroom needs replacing. Not that it matters anymore. (finds Anne standing in the corner with a wide smile; exclaims) Mother of pearl!
Stumpy: Deer Sprig, you have a visitor.
Stumpy: Don't go anywhere.
Stumpy: Duckweed! He's here!
Stumpy: Harsh, but on point.
Stumpy: Here you are. Four bowls of slop. Enjoy. Or don't. Makes no difference to me.
Stumpy: How long you been here?
Stumpy: I gotta hand it to you, Anne. This place looks great. We even scrubbed the Wally out.
Stumpy: I say... you just put me out of business. Bound to happen eventually, I suppose.
Stumpy: I've never seen this place so packed. What-- What's this weird feeling in me chest?
Stumpy: I, uh, I beg your pardon. What?
Stumpy: It's carved from the bones of me missing hand.
Stumpy: It's not a squid. It's a kraken.
Stumpy: Kid, what are you doing?
Stumpy: Kid, what have you done? That was the most popular critic in town. One bad review from him and we're finished.
Stumpy: Look, kid, you're on your own. Do whatever you want. It's not gonna make a difference in the end, anyway.
Stumpy: Looks like our number's up.
Stumpy: Mm... Oh, that's good.
Stumpy: No way, Anne. This whole thing was a big success. You even convinced this old grump to actually care. If your parents could see this, I'm sure they'd be proud.
Stumpy: Not especially. We're just glad you're back.
Stumpy: Oh! How about we all meet at my restaurant tonight? Have a town dinner for the Plantars.
Stumpy: Oh. I'm gonna need me hammer hand for this.
Stumpy: Okay. (Anne smacks him.) I already said okay!
Stumpy: One at a time.
Stumpy: Ooh. Been there.
Stumpy: Thanks for coming.
Stumpy: That's it. It's over. We're finished! The second that review goes up, this restaurant goes down.
Stumpy: The critic is gonna be blown away.
Stumpy: There be a problem, sir?
Stumpy: This is Sashimi. He's a mudskipper.
Stumpy: This one is for bashing and smashing.
Stumpy: This one is for slicing and dicing.
Stumpy: Well, ya can't get fresher.
Stumpy: What do you mean? Like placemats?
Stumpy: What do you want?
Stumpy: What's a sashimi?
Stumpy: You think I'm gonna let you in here after you called me a thief?
Sylvia: Been a long time since I've danced with someone. Might be nice to feel the embrace of a man.
Sylvia: Hello, children. I'm so glad I get to join you all on this boat trip.
Sylvia: I have a soft spot for the weird ones, remember?
Sylvia: Isn't he dreamy?
Sylvia: Oh, Hopediah!
Sylvia: Well, Hopediah.
Sylvia: Why, Monroe. I'd be delighted.
Sylvia: Why, yes you may, Hopediah Plantar.
Tadpole: Do it again! Do it again!
Tadpole: Mommy, Mommy! Give the freak money!
Tan Newt Soldier: Yeah, use that big brain of yours.
Teddy: Ah!
Teddy: All right, time to pick a card. Juliet, I think you went first last time, so, Juniper, you go first.
Teddy: And we'll go put your snail in the barn.
Teddy: Don't you dare leave. (groans)
Teddy: My marinade!
Teddy: Now, just hold on a second--
Teddy: Oh, come on, Martha. No one makes a slumberdoodle better than you, and you know that.
Teddy: Oh, dear.
Teddy: Oh, hey there. Welcome to the Dandy Lion B&B. I'm Teddy. This is my wife, Martha.
Teddy: Oh, no need. We only have a couple of guests tonight, so the inn is mostly empty.
Teddy: Ooh, thanks honey. Hey, do you hear that? Did you leave the sink running?
Teddy: So, I take it you'll be needing some rooms?
Teddy: Well, I guess I'll just have to be happy with the boy. Cook time will be much shorter. Delicious.
Teddy: Well, let me just go get the marinade ready and--
Teddy: Yeah, we traveled here a long time ago and just, you know, (chuckles) fell in love with the area. Isn't that right, sweetie?
Teddy: Yeah, what can a legless little tadpole like you do to stop us?
Teen worker: Hey! Didn't you see the sign, scarecrow?
Teenage worker: Actually, you're short.
Teenage worker: Huh. Couldn't say. I see a lot of shells.
Teenage worker: Thanks. I use product.
Teenage worker: Uh, no one except the baker, really.
Teenage worker: Um, we're having kind of a rough season.
Teenage worker: Yes! Yes! I remember now! Out there. Late morning!
The Curator: (chuckles)
The Curator: (grunts) That's what I get for going with a cheap machine. (grunts)
The Curator: (laughs) That's the stuff. Now, since you're my main attraction, I'm gonna let you in on this museum's biggest secret. You see, truth is nothing's fake. Everything here is real. Real and frozen in wax. Just like you!
The Curator: (laughs) Um, uh, then it hits me. Artifacts. You can charge people when they break 'em. (munches) Win-win!
The Curator: (lifts his eyepatch up) Sweet tadpole Mary!
The Curator: Ah! The Skip Man. It can be yours... for a million coppers! (laughs)
The Curator: And Newtopia's got a ton of 'em. That's where I got that, uh, Skip guy you wanted.
The Curator: And if you chuck some of that cash into this here sack, I'll give you a tour of the greatest museum these parts have to offer!
The Curator: Bup, bup, bup. All in good time, kid. You'll get what's coming to you.
The Curator: Calm down, everyone. It's just wax.
The Curator: Hands off the merchandise!
The Curator: Hey, hey. Don't talk about yourself like that! You're probably a very bright young lady who's just having a bad day.
The Curator: Hey. It's what I'm here for. So, as you've probably guessed, you're not just the main attraction tomorrow. You'll be here forever! (laughs)
The Curator: Hmm. What's the matter, honey? Face too ugly for public? Ha!
The Curator: I mean, it's crazy how easy that was! Honestly, I thought I was being way too obvious about it.
The Curator: I think I got it. (grunts) Now we're cooking with gas, or whatever it is we frogs use.
The Curator: I've already got some pretty elaborate plans for your exhibit. Come back tonight after closing time and we can discuss.
The Curator: Just a couple of common frogs. Ooh. I can stick 'em in the same mold. Call 'em the Two-headed Frog of Froglantis. (laughs) It's genius!
The Curator: Looks like the end of the line for you two.
The Curator: Looks like we just hit paydirt, Frog Soos.
The Curator: No! My beautiful creations!
The Curator: Oh. A mystery. I love it! But enough chitchat. Walk with me. I've traveled all over Amphibia, collecting its most rare and frightening creatures. Like the two-headed love dove. There's... I dunno, probably some kinda marriage allegory in there. Oh, and over here, the bugball playing praying mantis, Airbug! There's nothing in the rule book that says a mantis can't play bugball. I got the weirdest stuff right here. Feel free to look around. But keep in mind, breathing in the dust will be extra. (laughs)
The Curator: Okay, fine. How about we trade for it then? Got anything rare or vomit-inducing I could display in exchange?
The Curator: Say no more, kid. One day of you in exchange for the Skip thing and everything I know about it. You got a deal.
The Curator: Say, why don't you stand up there? Soak it all in.
The Curator: Say, you want some of this canned meat? It's edible!
The Curator: Stay back, you filthy animals! You'll never catch me!
The Curator: The ol' "mistaken for a grotesque lifeless being!" Works every time! Welcome to my Museum of Oddities. I go by many names, but you can call me "The Curator."
The Curator: Welcome, welcome. So glad my little star is here! And every star needs a stage.
The Curator: Who are you? A cop? I ain't going back to frog prison!
The Curator: You definitely caught me! Wait, wait! Hear me out! I'll cut you all in on the profits. 10%. Okay, 11%. 11.5%. I'm not coming to 12. So you might as well just...
The Curator: You've been licking yourself again, Frog Soos?
The Plantars and Marcy: Whoa!
The Plantars and Marcy: Yeah!
The Plantars, Anne, and Marcy: Wow!
The Plantars: (gasps)
The Plantars: (groan and cough)
The Plantars: Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Hot tub.
Three random frogs: (burps)
Toad (offscreen): Captain Grime, sir. Bog has just returned from Wartwood and is waiting for you in the briefing room.
Toad Guard 1: Another day, another wounded orphan to move.
Toad Guard 2: This ankle isn't twisted.
Toad Guards: Stop! Stop! No, no, no!
Toad Scientist: Last Toad Summit was all about improvements to Toad armor durability. This year, the R & D team gives you armor customization.
Toad Soldier 1: No! Sorry. Uh, you frogs aren't allowed to leave this room.
Toad Soldier 1: Uh... I've said too much. Please just return to the party and remain calm.
Toad Soldier 1: Whew, thanks, kid.
Toad Soldier 2: All right, that does it! (pulls out his mace)
Toad Soldier 2: Calm down, you frogs, calm-- (grunting) Knock it off!
Toad Soldier 2: You lot have made a huge mistake.
Toad Soldier 3: (groans) Ouchie!
Toad Soldier 3: Enjoy your time with Commander Sasha.
Toad Soldier 4: Hey, that's mine.
Toad Soldier 5: In retrospect, we really should have tied them up.
Toad Soldier 5: We gotta get out of here!
Toad Soldier 6: Move, move, move!
Toad Soldier: Did somebody say weapons?
Toad soldier: Bull's-eye!
Toad soldier: Captain Grime!?
Toad soldier: Captain Grime's here!?
Toad soldier: It's Captain Grime!
Toad soldier: Work that tongue. Yeah, come on!
Toad: Hup, hup, hup, hup!
Toadie: (Carrying a bag of coins) Aren't these worthless, sir?
Toadie: (clears throat) Uh, hey. (Record scratches) Before we start, does anyone want a Post-it note? Can't have a good meeting without Post-it notes.
Toadie: (enters) Madame, generals. They're here.
Toadie: (panting) Coming, sir.
Toadie: (screams)
Toadie: (sits up) Oh, I stopped having opinions years ago. I'm just 100% here to support you.
Toadie: Ah!
Toadie: Ahem! Miss Frog of the Year? There's someone waiting at the bridge for you. They say they're a friend.
Toadie: All right sir, I'm ready for rehearsal.
Toadie: But my comfort zone is so comfy.
Toadie: For Hunter!
Toadie: Got you!
Toadie: He accepts. He accepts!
Toadie: He looks strong.
Toadie: Hey, should we be worried about them?
Toadie: I got you, sir.
Toadie: I know the feeling. But no matter how badly you want someone to succeed, you can't force it. Because sometimes being a good friend just means being there for them when they need it the most.
Toadie: I said no comment!
Toadie: Just me. Toadie. (laughs) Wow.
Toadie: Love it!
Toadie: Ma'am, I think I found you the perfect dress for tonight.
Toadie: Master stroke, sir.
Toadie: Mayor's napping. Everyone is already in a band. Who am I supposed to play music with that will also boss me around?
Toadie: Mr. Plantar, an anonymous associate would like to speak with you.
Toadie: My point is, most people don't realize just how fun it can be to support someone you really care about.
Toadie: No comment.
Toadie: No problem!
Toadie: Nope! Back to the comfort zone!
Toadie: Not at this stand, you won't! No coin, no stand. Time to clear out!
Toadie: Of course, ma'am. But before I do, could I get an autograph? I'm a huge fan.
Toadie: Oh, it's one of our oldest traditions. The Frog of the Year has to put on an incredible party for the whole town.
Toadie: Okay, sir. Item one, there are some potholes that need filling, but the money we have left is supposed to buy us that (whispering) swanky new Jacuzzi.
Toadie: Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Toadie: Sir, please help me.
Toadie: T-t-time for myself?
Toadie: The victory pinata is all set up in the lobby, sir.
Toadie: There, there, sir.
Toadie: Think you could carry me again, sir?
Toadie: This is gonna hurt!
Toadie: Totally here for it.
Toadie: Uh, this is a little hard to read.
Toadie: Um, Mrs. Croaker? (feet screech) As much as I'd like to be on offense with Walliam, I'd be much more comfortable as the...
Toadie: Um, sir?
Toadie: We brought the fancy snail.
Toadie: We have a formation for this?
Toadie: Well, maybe you should try letting go a little. Let someone else take the reins. Pass the baton. Hand over the keys-
Toadie: Well, nothing left to do but accept our fate. Anyone want a Post-it note for their will?
Toadie: Who are you, and what have you done with my beautiful Mayor?
Toadie: With a passion, sir!
Toadie: Yes, ma'am.
Toads: (laughter)
Toadstood: Uh... And as mayor, I hereby pardon myself of any wrongdoing. Thank you. Good day.
Toadstool (on speaker): And now, the moment y'all been waiting for. Let the show begin!
Toadstool: (chuckles) Glad you're enjoying yourself. Stick with me and I'll make sure you never go out of style. Now take care of those warts. Toodles.
Toadstool: (groans)
Toadstool: (groans) Got you.
Toadstool: (grunting) Oh! Oh!
Toadstool: (grunting) Oh, my giblets! I've got you! No, I don't!
Toadstool: A solid effort by Hopediah Plantar! But how will Monroe respond?
Toadstool: Ah, so glad you could join me, Plantar. I'll give it to you straight. I want you to lose tomorrow's trial.
Toadstool: All right, now. Everybody settle down. I have some bad news. The acting troupe had to cancel on account of...well, being eaten on the way here.
Toadstool: And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. It's time to cut open the grubhog!
Toadstool: And stay out of Alastairville.
Toadstool: Anne, my dear. Care to join me for a joyride?
Toadstool: Anne, we can help each other. I can make sure you stay popular, and in turn, you can help me improve my reputation. How does that sound?
Toadstool: Anne, what are you doing? You're throwing it all away? Now how am I supposed to convince these idiots to vote for me?
Toadstool: Come on, Toadie. While the townsfolk are preoccupied.
Toadstool: Come on.
Toadstool: Cute and cuddly. He's here. And now, the ceremonial feeding and cleaning of the grubhog!
Toadstool: Did I say "idiots"? I meant lovely, lovely townspeople, eh? (chuckles) Uh, simmer down now. Simmer-- Whoa. This is an outrage! Stop that!
Toadstool: Frogs, friends. Welcome to the annual Grubhog Celebration!
Toadstool: Get a hold of yourself, Toadie. Since we saved a couple of lives at Toad Tower, people have been seeing me a little differently. And, well, frog dang it, it's rubbing off on me.
Toadstool: Good. Now get out there. Your public awaits.
Toadstool: Here we are. From now on, Anne, this is your home.
Toadstool: Hey! Get after him.
Toadstool: Hmm... You know what, Toadie? You go ahead and fill those holes.
Toadstool: Hmm?
Toadstool: I ain't never seen moves like those. It's horrifying.
Toadstool: I know what these dumb birds want. Money. All right, all right. Here's your handout.
Toadstool: Incoming!
Toadstool: It's as if embezzling money from the town makes you the bad guy! (groans) If we don't fix things soon, we'll lose next month's election for sure. The only thing that can save us now is a miracle.
Toadstool: It's flawless, Toadie. The perfect plan. Who would think to look for the missing taxes in plain sight?
Toadstool: Just let it happen, Toadie.
Toadstool: Like we talked about. Stay down, Plantar.
Toadstool: No, uh-- What's gotten into you, boy? Has the grubhog taken over your mind?
Toadstool: No, you dimwit, lose on purpose! In return, I'll give you a new vegetable stand. Heck, I'll put it in the center of the market, tax free! You'll make tons of money.
Toadstool: Nope. I'm afraid only Anne is invited. Just look at those beautiful warts. (chuckles)
Toadstool: Now remember, spots in the liver means?
Toadstool: Now, now, wait. Simmer down, simmer down. I-I now hand it over to the next town scandal just waiting to happen. Sprig Plantar!
Toadstool: Oh! What's this? It appears two stallions have taken to the floor and are about to battle it out!
Toadstool: Oh, good. You're here. Toadie, give 'em the list.
Toadstool: Oh, my dear Toadie, I do believe our miracle has arrived.
Toadstool: Oh, this is bad, Toadie. People hate us!
Toadstool: Okay! That's enough of that. Pack it up. Dance is over! Everyone go home!
Toadstool: Ow! Okay, Plantar! You've put on a good show but... that's enough!
Toadstool: People, I needed the extra money for my campaign. Do you have any idea how much it costs to buy your love?
Toadstool: Quickly now. Let's skedaddle before anyone notices--
Toadstool: Stay down!
Toadstool: Thank you. Thank you all. You're all too kind. Democracy wins again!
Toadstool: The Plantars? Anne, honey, I thought we talked about this. Hanging out with those bumpkins will only pull you down to their level. I think it's for the best that you not be seen with them anymore. Understand?
Toadstool: There you are, my dear. I was so worried.
Toadstool: This is getting out of hand, Toadie. I could actually lose! Looks like we'll have to stop him... Ow! the old-fashioned way. Illegally.
Toadstool: Unbelievable!
Toadstool: Upsy-daisy.
Toadstool: Vote Mayor Toadstool! If reelected, I will always look out for the little guy.
Toadstool: Wait, wait now. You didn't campaign outside Wartwood? Oh, son. That's just sad. Really is. Almost takes the joy out of my victory.
Toadstool: Wake up, Plantar! The night is ruined! We've got no grubhog. All we got is a puppet that everyone seemed to love!
Toadstool: Well done, my boy. Well done. I must say this is the best ceremony we've ever had. Consider the Plantar name restored in full!
Toadstool: Well, I did say "almost." Wahoo! Pinata! I'm gonna hit it.
Toadstool: Well, Plantars, you've ruined everything surprising absolutely no one. I knew this goofy kid would mess things up somehow.
Toadstool: Well, looks like that's it for Hopediah. Unless he has something special or unique to show.
Toadstool: Well, then it's a good thing you'll never get to tell them.
Toadstool: Well, then, don't.
Toadstool: Well, you certainly gave this toad a run for his money. Good thing you didn't win though, huh? (laughs) A frog beating a toad. That would have made headlines! Just be proud the whole town loved ya. I'm surprised the rest of the valley didn't.
Toadstool: What are you, crazy? You could have been rich. You could've had your stand back. All you had to do was give up! (panting) Why?
Toadstool: What is it, Toadie? I... Oh.
Toadstool: Where is she? I'm losing a point in the polls every minute she's late.
Toadstool: Yeah, sure.
Toadstool: You've made a powerful enemy today, Hopediah. Toads have run uncontested for decades. This is a disgrace.
Toadtool: Ah! (grunts)
Toadtool: Leaping lily pads! What?
Toddler Anne:  I'll tell you what I need
Together: Hey, hey, hey! (Just before they reach the door, Hop Pop stops them.)
Tour Guide: (On the speakers) Welcome, ladies and gentle-phibians, to a safe uneventful afternoon of touristy nonsense. It may not be as eventful as other tours but did I mention it's safe?
Tour Guide: And now for our tour of the tour bus. This is the ceiling, what a good ceiling! Not to be outdone by the floor!
Tour Guide: Imminent danger. Look away!
Tour Guide: Nope. It's getting to know the city from a safe distance. Like on this bus.
Tour Guide: Now then, what's the most important thing to do when visiting Newtopia? Any guesses?
Townsfolk: Ooh.
Townsperson: My veggies!
Train Conductor: (sniffs) Poor kid. Guards! Help me!
Train Conductor: Hey! Get back here!
Train Conductor: Hey! The train!
Train Conductor: Huh? What the--
Train Conductor: I trusted you!
Train Conductor: Orphan!
Train Conductor: Thanks, kids. The tower's been trying to catch this slimeball for months. Been robbing trains with kids for quite some time now, the sicko.
Triple B: Fire! Fire! Fire! Somebody do something!
Tritonio (holding his laughter): Yes yes. What is it? Maybe paint a barn? Have a hoedown?
Tritonio (on his beetle vehicle): Newts! (pulls out his sword) To me!
Tritonio (sarcastic): Say Beatrix, did you hear something just now?
Tritonio (while he and the newts do the pose): If it's to make us all feel stupid, it's working.
Tritonio: (laughs) Excellent! You've all improved so much. Especially you, Anne. (winks at her)
Tritonio: (laughs) I have to say, even I am impressed.
Tritonio: (laughs) Oh, Anne. If I seem tougher on you, it's not because I don't like you. It's because I see a girl who is not living up to her full potential.
Tritonio: (narrating) When things get bad, it's always everyone for themselves.
Tritonio: (picks out the goatee under his chin) What do you think?
Tritonio: Absolutely not.
Tritonio: Adults, they shelter their children. I say no! (kicks a stick up to him) Teach them to fight. For danger lurks around every corner of Amphibia. Stay on your toes! Trust no one! Ah! Look over there! (points behind Sprig)
Tritonio: Ah! Big T's eyes!
Tritonio: Ah, excellent choice, Sprig.
Tritonio: Ah, the noble boom shroom. Small, unassuming, but in the right hands... (pushes on the stem, which causes the boom shroom to blink and make a beeping sound) Explosive!
Tritonio: Ah, they were good kids. Too bad they have to go to prison forever.
Tritonio: Ah, yes. I shall educate them! Teach them true discipline!
Tritonio: And now, I believe you are ready for this. (takes out a sword)
Tritonio: And this is no mere day care. This is a Combat Crash Course for kids.
Tritonio: Anne, your hand placement is all wrong!
Tritonio: As will we.
Tritonio: Bingo.
Tritonio: Come on.
Tritonio: Even your fall needs work, Anne.
Tritonio: Even, bad ones?
Tritonio: Finally. It is just us now. So let us cast aside these illusions, yes? (tears off his clothes, revealing another suit underneath) Ah!
Tritonio: From what I have seen, you do not have the dexterity to wield a sword. Pick something else.
Tritonio: Greetings, I am Tritonio Espada, the instructor of this day care.
Tritonio: Here, children, your quinoa macro bowls are ready. (looks around) Where is the gangly one? Does she not like quinoa?
Tritonio: Hopediah came to us and got us thinking. If Beatrix does her original plan and attack Andrias' front door...
Tritonio: I propose a more intelligent approach. We take a small strike force, dress them up as orphans, sneak past the guards, and steal the box.
Tritonio: I said trust no one! Now, follow me, and we will begin the next lesson.
Tritonio: Indeed. But when you find yourself outmatched, think outside the box.
Tritonio: Indeed. In you, I sense someone that, with a little effort could achieve greatness. And I am sure your teachers back home felt the same way.
Tritonio: It would be a waste of time, Sasha. I mean, who can fix 900 years of conflict in a day?
Tritonio: Let me guess. You want to bash in a front door, beat up anyone you see, and take the music box.
Tritonio: No! Wrong!
Tritonio: No, Anne. More nimble!
Tritonio: Now, come. It is time for your final test.
Tritonio: Oh, yes? And what is that?
Tritonio: Oh.
Tritonio: Only because you toads are too slow... (he covers his nose alongside with Jojo) ...and smelly I might add.
Tritonio: Parry, swing! Imagine I'm a fearsome assassin. Or perhaps, a meddlesome train conductor.
Tritonio: Perfect for you, I think. (hands Polly the boom shroom) Who's next? No wrong answers.
Tritonio: Proud is an understatement!
Tritonio: See you around, Anne. I wasn't kidding when I said you had potential. You certainly bested me.
Tritonio: Sorry, kids, but I never could've robbed this train by myself. And now that I have what I want, I'll be going. Give my regards to the guards! (laughs)
Tritonio: Sprig, Polly, nice work!
Tritonio: That's it, children! Feel the stone beneath your hands, the strong breeze in your hair. Much like the breeze on a fast-moving train.
Tritonio: The Bogwaters retired last year and sold their business to me.
Tritonio: The idea does have merit.
Tritonio: This blade has been in my family for many years, and now it is yours. Get some sleep, Anne, for tomorrow, the real training begins. (jumps off the tower) Way-ha-ho!
Tritonio: Tomorrow is our last day together. So I put together an exercise to test all the skills you've learned. I have rented a train, inside of which, I have hidden a fake priceless ruby. Also, I have hired actors to portray guards who will stop at nothing to keep the ruby safe. You must retrieve it using the wisdom and skills I have taught you. Now, study these plans. Become one with the plans. Eat the plans. (tears off a piece of the plan and eats it, his lips smacking. He then jumps away.) Eh, up! We leave at dawn!
Tritonio: Toodles!
Tritonio: Typical toad maneuver. It'll never work.
Tritonio: Well, Anne was right. We can't count on anyone else to solve our deep-rooted problems.
Tritonio: What? I like you.
Tritonio: With the right orphan costume you can trick anyone. It's proven.
Tritonio: Wonderful, Sprig! (Polly hops through the tires) Polly, truly inspiring. (Anne steps into a tire) No, Anne. Knees higher!
Tritonio: You do have to respect my creativity.
Tritonio: You must eat, Anne. Only a fool fights on an empty stomach.
Tritonio: You've all done so well. Ah, here it is, the Tiger Moth's Eye. Now, I have one more question. What was the first lesson I taught you?
Tritonio: Your next lesson is to pick your weapon. Find one that resonates with you.
Tuti: Am town healer, Tuti. Also part-time bounty hunter.
Tuti: Full body is good. Come, we get personal.
Tuti: Here, extra.
Tuti: Hmm.
Tuti: I help you?
Tuti: Is done. You are reborn.
Tuti: Is same.
Tuti: Pollywog gone. You talk to no one.
Tuti: Scammers? Fake? (yells) Come. I lead way.
Tuti: Tuti caught thief!
Uh, only 9:00 p.m.?
Valeriana: Could it be, Leander? Could she be the one we've been searching for?
Vendor: -My pots!
Villager 1: Does the, uh, grubhog look a little bit off to you?
Villager 1: That's what it is.
Villager 2: Uh, they probably changed its diet.
Villager(dragging away a cannon): Glad I finally got a chance to use this bad boy.
Villager: A moovie.
Villager: Ah! It's hideous.
Villager: Amazing.
Villager: Are these grubs organic?
Villager: Are they real?
Villager: Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Villager: Definitely Alastair.
Villager: Get him!
Villager: Get out of here, you scoundrel.
Villager: Got to get ready!
Villager: He's got Anne's shoe.
Villager: Hey, everyone, that's Anne's foot.
Villager: I don't know. Toadstool is tried and true.
Villager: I don't think she's gonna make it.
Villager: I third it.
Villager: I wanna touch them.
Villager: I'm gonna feed this to my baby.
Villager: It's Monroe.
Villager: It's not looking good.
Villager: It's so exotic.
Villager: Leapin' larva! Look!
Villager: Let's get outta here.
Villager: Let's hear it for Hopediah!
Villager: Like I'd buy beans from a monster.
Villager: Look over there.
Villager: Mmm.
Villager: Monroe does it again!
Villager: Napkins? What are those?
Villager: Not even close.
Villager: Oh, my goodness.
Villager: Show's over.
Villager: Sounds good to me.
Villager: Stumpy's changed overnight.
Villager: Stunning.
Villager: Technically proficient.
Villager: That's good.
Villager: They're warts. Beautiful, ruby-red warts.
Villager: Three cheers for the girl with the ruby-red warts.
Villager: We need you. Please...
Villager: What a waste of time.
Villager: What's going on?
Villager: Wow, look over there.
Villager: Yay!
Villager: Yeah, I think so.
Villager: You know, that wasn't half bad.
Villagers: (all laughing)
Villagers: (screaming)
Villagers: Anne, we love you!
Villagers: She's hideous again.
Vince: Yeah!
Vulture: Think nothing of it, Lord. I have not forgotten the aid you gave my people. To where do we fly?
Wally:  La la la la laa La la laa 
Wally:  Oh, I'm a vagrant With a heart of gold  (falls) Aw. Whoop.
Wally: (Playing his concertina) A frog child and a monster from the woods getting along? So unnatural. (He plays an unusual note.)
Wally: (burps)
Wally: (chuckles) It's what I'm good at! Direct physical confrontation, not so much. (screams) Oh, my gosh! I blew up Maddie!
Wally: (singing, screams) Jumping June bugs! What's all this about?
Wally: (stunned)
Wally: (whimpering)
Wally: *chuckles* A season at least.
Wally: *gasps* Then you leave me no choice.
Wally: *grunts* (pulls his accordion out of a hole in the floor) It's just too risky, Anne. I have to hide these around the house, or I'd lose my mind.
Wally: A what?
Wally: Ah. He missed.
Wally: All right. You know how to do this?
Wally: And I choose Fiddle Leaf.
Wally: Anne?
Wally: Aw!
Wally: But I didn't actually mean it.
Wally: Can we have a pinata party?
Wally: Come on, Anne. We're so close.
Wally: Dang, kid. You got the burp of a titan!
Wally: Did you say newts... and toads... coming here... to work with us?!
Wally: Disgusting. (He keeps playing his concertina and walks off.)
Wally: Do your worst.
Wally: Eaten by flies? Oh, the irony!
Wally: Gosh!
Wally: Hi, Mrs. Croaker.
Wally: Hit it, Pops.
Wally: Hope.
Wally: Hopediah? Uh, may we have a word?
Wally: Hopidiah, Sprig, wanna join me and Loggle's jug band?
Wally: I accept.
Wally: I can finally be myself.
Wally: I don't want to leave forever. I just want to be able to be me, wherever I am. (hugs his dad)
Wally: I like the other news better!
Wally: I love dramatic irony!
Wally: I nominate Hopediah Plantar for mayor!
Wally: I'm totally freaking out!
Wally: I've got one. What say we plant these boomshrooms around the joint? Blow the place sky high.
Wally: I-I only lied because I didn't think you'd accept the real me.
Wally: If my family won't accept me for who I truly am, then I don't want to be a Ribbiton anymore. I challenge you to a winner-takes-all duel!
Wally: Just a little gift for our generous hosts. (laughs)
Wally: Let me out! Let me out!
Wally: Loud and clear.
Wally: Maybe if they could see how happy I was living in Wartwood, they'd understand and accept me for who I am. *groans* Who am I kidding. Well, I better go get ready for dinner.
Wally: Meet Fiddle Leaf. I've been riding her since I was a wee tadpole.
Wally: Nothing like scavenging the remains of a broken frog family.
Wally: Of course, I do. But you have to accept me for who I am. Both Walliam and Wally.
Wally: Oh, no!
Wally: Oh, no. They couldn't--
Wally: Oh, she's brave.
Wally: Oh, um--
Wally: Oh, what day is it?
Wally: Oi! I can't write. (laughs)
Wally: Ooh. Gotta go. *laughs* (falls)
Wally: Ouch! (He appears from the grass carrying Polly.) Uh... totally wasn't watching. Nothing creepy going on here. Say, that looks like fun. Mind if I give it a try?
Wally: Ready.
Wally: Right, Father. Can't wait for that. *sighs*
Wally: Right. We're not doing it.
Wally: Rubbish. I may live in squalor, but I always pay my taxes.
Wally: Sign-ups for the election! You been living under a rock? 'Cause I have and even I knew that.
Wally: So much of my past is here. It would break my heart to leave it all behind. (opens one of the doors)
Wally: Steady. He's still my dad.
Wally: Thanks, Anne, for everything. Well, not everything.
Wally: Thanks.
Wally: That hurt me soul.
Wally: That's what you think! (laughs)
Wally: That's what you think. (pulls his accordion out of Anne's hair)
Wally: The truth is I live like a bum in Wartwood because... Well, it's what I love. This life may look nice but there's so many rules. And if my family knew the real me, well, they'd disown me for sure.
Wally: This is different. This is my family we're talking about.
Wally: Three cheers for Anne, defender of Wartwood.
Wally: Too many questions!
Wally: Turns out dad's still got it. We might be in trouble.
Wally: Two parties in one night.
Wally: Two parties in one night? Whoo-hoo!
Wally: Uh, yes, Father. I met them on my business travels.
Wally: Validation! (cackles)
Wally: Wait. What?
Wally: Well, come with me and I'll show you. (walks and bumps into the wall) Meant to do that.
Wally: Well, here. Put this bit in your mouth. (gives Anne a rein)
Wally: Well, then what am I supposed to ride?
Wally: What can I say? I sleep better with company.
Wally: What? I thought we agreed. Wait, could you not tell I was winking? Ah, curse you, one eye!
Wally: Who did she pick? I'm so frustrated right now!
Wally: Why did you do that?!
Wally: Ya snooze, ya lose, scarecrow. (guffaws)
Wally: Yeah!
Wally: Yeah, you leave our Anne alone.
Wally: Yeah. She's got ours!
Wally: Yes. That's right, Father. These are my servants. *groans*
Wally: You know what, Anne? You've done enough already. I've got to face the music on my own. (leaves, playing the accordion)
Wally: You've been holding out on me.
Wart: (chuckles, taunts)
Wart: (squeals)
What time is it anyway? 5:00 a.m.? 6:00 a.m.?
Wigbert: (referring to Anne) And this must be some kind of exotic beast you tamed. Though I sooner would have had it stuffed.
Wigbert: (throws the ball) *grunts*
Wigbert: *clears throat* A toast to Walliam's valet. *shrieks*
Wigbert: *clears throat* Walliam! That is how you've been acting outside of Ribbitvale? Unacceptable. You have brought shame onto the house of Ribbiton. Worse, you've been lying to us.
Wigbert: *gasps*
Wigbert: *grunts*
Wigbert: *laughs*
Wigbert: *laughs* Anyhow, I am Wigbert Ribbiton.
Wigbert: Hello. Looks like someone needs repairs. My mechanics will make her right as rain in no time.
Wigbert: Here we are.
Wigbert: Hiya!
Wigbert: Hiyah!
Wigbert: I choose Andromeda.
Wigbert: I don't see why not.
Wigbert: I suppose we can do that. Ah, accordion, eh? You know, I used to love playing the jug, but I gave it up a long, long time ago. Oh, all right. You got me. *grunts* (reveals a hole in the field where he was hiding jugs)
Wigbert: It's, uh, one of our smaller rooms but please enjoy.
Wigbert: Not so fast. Fiddle Leaf is a Ribbiton family beast. Since you no longer wish to be a Ribbiton, you can't ride any of them.
Wigbert: Ow! *clears throat* Well, son, I concede defeat. I suppose this means goodbye forever. *sobs*
Wigbert: Some of my prizewinning birds. Ever seen a frog torn in half by a peacock? Grizzly stuff.
Wigbert: That's us. And when I retire, Walliam here will be head of the Ribbiton family empire. Right, Walliam?
Wigbert: These must be your servants from Wartwood then.
Wigbert: Very well. One-on-one Beast Polo. You win, you can leave Ribbitvale and live however you like. You lose, you take over the family business and stay in Ribbitvale forever.
Wigbert: Walliam, you know these pungent common folk, do you?
Wigbert: Well, you weren't wrong. We do not accept this. You are henceforth forbidden to leave this town.
Wigbert: What in heavens?!
Wigbert: You mean you still want to be a Ribbiton?
Wigbert: You'll be joining us back at the mansion, of course?
Woman: Hopediah?
Woman: Look away, Teddy. Look away.
Woman: Oh, gracious!
Woman: This is not for children's eyes!
Young Anne and Marcy: (laugh and scream)
Young Anne and Marcy: (start crying)
Young Anne and Marcy: Whoa!
Young Anne: Hey, you wanna swing with us?
Young Anne: I'm Anne, by the way. This is Marcy.
Young Anne: Look, Marmar! I'm an eagle!
Young Anne: Mom, can I please try some of that?
Young Marcy: Cool! Well, I'm a twin engine cemax amphibious aircraft!
Young Marcy: Hiya!
Young Sasha: (laughs) Swings are all yours!
Young Sasha: (screams and trips)
Young Sasha: (screams and trips) I'm not done yet. I'll never give up! No matter what!
Young Sasha: I'm Sasha. Sasha Waybright!
Young Sasha: I-I'd like that.
Young Sasha: Not so fast, evildoers! Leave those kids alone!
Young Tritonio: Oh!
Young Tritonio: Wait for me!
Yunan: And the traitor, Grime, is still at large and is currently being aided by a--aah!
Yunan: Sire?
Yunan: The political situation is worsening, Your Highness. What started as a small valley riot is quickly becoming something more. Not only that, the toad lords have agreed to meet. This could spell disaster.
