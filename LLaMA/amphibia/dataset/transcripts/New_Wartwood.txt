(It's morning in Wartwood, and Marcy (who's staying in the fwagon) kicks the door open full of energy.)
Marcy: Woo! Look out Amphibia! It's Marcy's first day in Wartwood!
(She rushes down to the basement fists in the air, where Anne's shown still asleep.)
Marcy: First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood! First day in Wartwood!
(She leaves.)
Anne: (asleep) Five more minutes.
(Marcy's now flying over town on Joe Sparrow.)
Marcy: First day! First day! First day! First day! Woo!
(The two land.)
Marcy: (gasps) It's so cute! It's got a folksy country vibe.
Random frog: (burps)
Marcy: Colorful characters.
Three random frogs: (burps)
Marcy: Gosh, Anne was right. It's the perfect little farm town! (The frog captured by the dragonfly flies over and burps in the background.) And now, to introduce myself.
Mrs. Croaker: Oh, those look fresh.
Marcy: Hi! My name is Marcy. What's your name?
Mrs Croaker: Oh, great. Just what we need. Another outsider. (walks off)
Marcy: (waves to the merchant) Hello!
(The merchant closes down his stand.)
Marcy: HI there! My name is Marcy. Do you have any time to talk about its unique architectural history?
Maddie's Sisters: Uh...
Baby Sister #2: Are you a weirdo?
(Wally is shown playing his accordion on a barrel.)
Marcy: Oh, my gosh! Are you a vagrant? Is that an accordion? Is that eye really gone?
Wally: Too many questions!
(He throws his accordion through a window and jumps through it. Marcy sighs. A bit later, Marcy sits at the statue in the middle of town when Anne walks up to her.)
Anne: Hey, Mar Mar. How's your first day in Wartwood going?
Marcy: Oh, great. Did you know this entire town is built on top of a swamp but never sinks? That's because the designers knew exactly how heavy to make everything.
Anne: That's a cool fact. (blushes) What else ya learn?
!Marcy |I also learned that small communities like this don't take kindly to strangers which mean's idon't have a chance. |-
!Anne |Don't be ridiculous of course, they'll accept you. |-
!Marcy |You sure about that? (points to an angry mob next to her) |-
!Anne |Guys, come on she's with me. |-
!Random frogs |All right if you say so. |-
!Anne |Wait, is that Polly? |-
!Polly |I go where the mob goes, Anne! |-
!Marcy |Hmm... |-
!Anne |They will warm up to you, it just takes time. |-
!Marcy |Time or maybe a strategy. |-
!Anne |Gonna say time still. |-
!Marcy |Come on in people are just another puzzle to solve, operation connect with wartwood engage, whoa whoa |-
!Random frog #1 |What the, the town founder whose name I don't even know, how dare she. |-
!Random Frog #2 |It's that clumsy outsides. |-
!Frog #3 |Will knock the whole city down before she's through. |-
!Marcy |No problem, no problem, I can fix it. |-
!Mrs. Croaker |Whoa, she fixed it. |-
!Anne |Whoa, when did you learn how to do that? |-
!Marcy |I took a sculpting class in Newtopia. |-
!Anne |You've been taking classes? |-
!Marcy |Yeah, haven't you? |-
!Random frog |Where are you? |-
!Female frog |You seem all right lady, for an outsider anyway, (spit) |-
!Marcy |Oh my gosh Anne, I just got a spit of approval, hmm... I did win the Newtopia over by improving their city, I bet I could do the same thing here in wartwood. |-
!Anne |I guess that can work. |-
!Marcy |Come on Anne, show me all the cruddy things to wrong with this town. |-
!Anne |Where do I even start? |-
(They start by filling potholes. They fill two, but a frog falls into the one behind them.)
Marcy: Should've started with that one.
